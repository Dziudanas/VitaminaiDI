For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet .\n",
    "Introduction": "Vitamin A is the name of a group of fat-soluble retinoids, primarily retinol and retinyl esters [ 1 , 2 ]. Vitamin A is involved in immune function, cellular communication, growth and development, and male and female reproduction [ 1-3 ]. Vitamin A supports cell growth and differentiation, playing a critical role in the normal formation and maintenance of the heart, lungs, eyes, and other organs [ 1 , 2 ]. Vitamin A is also critical for vision as an essential component of rhodopsin, the light-sensitive protein in the retina that responds to light entering the eye, and because it supports the normal differentiation and functioning of the conjunctival membranes and cornea [ 2 , 4 ].\nThe human diet contains two sources for vitamin A: preformed vitamin A (retinol and retinyl esters) and provitamin A carotenoids [ 1 , 5 ]. Preformed vitamin A is found in foods from animal sources, including dairy products, eggs, fish, and organ meats [ 1 , 2 ]. Provitamin A carotenoids are plant pigments that include beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin [ 1 ]. The body converts provitamin A carotenoids into vitamin A in the intestine via the beta-carotene monooxygenase type 1 BCMO1 enzyme [ 1 , 3 , 6 ], although conversion rates may have genetic variability [ 7 , 8 , 9 ]. Other carotenoids in food, such as lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin, are not converted into vitamin A and are referred to as non-provitamin A carotenoids; they might have other important activities not involving vitamin A formation [ 1 ].\nThe various forms of vitamin A are solubilized into micelles in the intestinal lumen and absorbed by duodenal mucosal cells [ 5 ]. Retinyl esters and provitamin A carotenoids are converted to retinol after uptake into the lumen (for retinyl esters) or absorption (for provitamin A carotenoids). Retinol is then oxidized to retinal and retinoic acid, the two main active vitamin A metabolites in the body [ 1 ]. Most of the body’s vitamin A is stored in the liver in the form of retinyl esters [ 1 ].\nRetinol and carotenoid levels are typically measured in plasma or serum because blood samples are easy to collect [ 1 ]. However, these levels are not always reliable indicators of vitamin A status because they do not decline until vitamin A levels in the liver and other storage sites are almost depleted and because acute and chronic infections can decrease serum and plasma retinol concentrations [ 1 ]. Most vitamin A is stored in the liver, so measuring vitamin A levels in the liver is the best way to assess vitamin A adequacy [ 1 ]. In clinical studies, specialized research laboratories can measure liver vitamin A reserves indirectly using isotope-dilution or dose-response methods, in which plasma levels of retinol, a tracer surrogate, or both are measured over several days after the administration of vitamin A [ 1 ].\nIn clinical practice, plasma retinol levels alone can be used to document significant deficiency. A serum or plasma retinol concentration of 20 mcg/dL (0.70 micromoles/L) or less frequently reflects moderate vitamin A deficiency, and a level of 10 mcg/dL (0.35 micromoles/L) or less is considered an indicator of severe vitamin A deficiency [ 1 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for vitamin A and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [ 5 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nRDAs for vitamin A are given as retinol activity equivalents (RAE) to account for the different bioactivities of retinol and provitamin A carotenoids, all of which are converted by the body into retinol (see Table 1). One mcg RAE is equivalent to 1 mcg retinol, 2 mcg supplemental beta-carotene, 12 mcg dietary beta-carotene, or 24 mcg dietary alpha-carotene or beta-cryptoxanthin [ 5 ].\n*AI, equivalent to the mean intake of vitamin A in healthy, breastfed infants.\nThe units of measurement for vitamin A are now mcg RAE, but International Units (IUs) were previously used [ 10 ]. To convert IU to mcg RAE, use the following [ 11-13 ]:\n1 IU retinol = 0.3 mcg RAE 1 IU supplemental beta-carotene = 0.3 mcg RAE 1 IU dietary beta-carotene = 0.05 mcg RAE 1 IU dietary alpha-carotene or beta-cryptoxanthin = 0.025 mcg RAE\nRAE can only be directly converted into IUs if the sources of vitamin A are known. For example, the RDA of 900 mcg RAE for adolescent and adult men is equivalent to 3,000 IU if the food or supplement source is preformed vitamin A (retinol) or if the supplement source is beta-carotene. This RDA is also equivalent to 18,000 IU beta-carotene from food or to 36,000 IU alpha-carotene or beta-cryptoxanthin from food. Therefore, a mixed diet containing 900 mcg RAE provides between 3,000 and 36,000 IU vitamin A, depending on the foods consumed.\n",
    "Food": "Concentrations of preformed vitamin A are highest in liver, fish, eggs, and dairy products [ 1 ]. Most dietary provitamin A in the U.S. diet comes from leafy green vegetables, orange and yellow vegetables, tomato products, fruits, and some vegetable oils [ 1 , 5 , 14 ]. Vitamin A is routinely added to some foods, including milk and margarine [ 1 , 2 ]. Some ready-to-eat cereals are also fortified with vitamin A.\nAbout 65% to 80% of vitamin A consumed in the United States and other high-income countries comes from preformed vitamin A, whereas provitamin A is the main form consumed in low-income countries, where diets include more plant-based foods [ 2 , 15 ]. Among U.S. children and adolescents, enriched and fortified foods account for 34%–40% of vitamin A intakes from food [ 16 ].\nThe body might absorb up to 75% to 100% of retinol and, in most cases, 10% to 30% of beta-carotene from foods [ 17 , 18 ]. Cooking and heat treatment can increase the bioavailability of beta-carotene from foods [ 19 ].\nTable 2 lists a variety of foods and their vitamin A content per serving. The foods from animal sources in Table 2 contain primarily preformed vitamin A, the plant-based foods have provitamin A, and the foods with a mixture of ingredients from animals and plants contain both preformed vitamin A and provitamin A.\n*DV = Daily Value. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for vitamin A is 900 mcg RAE for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 11 ], where 1 mcg RAE = 1 mcg retinol, 2 mcg beta-carotene from supplements, 12 mcg beta-carotene from foods, 24 mcg alpha-carotene, or 24 mcg beta-cryptoxanthin. FDA does not require food labels to list vitamin A content unless vitamin A has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) FoodData Central lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing vitamin A arranged by nutrient content and by food name .\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "Vitamin A is available in stand-alone supplements and most multivitamins, often in the form of retinyl acetate, retinyl palmitate, provitamin A beta-carotene, or a combination [ 1 , 21 ]. Amounts of vitamin A in supplements vary widely, but 3,000 mcg RAE (333% of the DV) is common [ 21 ]. Multivitamins commonly have somewhat lower amounts, often 750 to 1,050 mcg RAE (83% to 117% of the DV).\nThe absorption of preformed vitamin A esters from dietary supplements is 70%–90%, and that of beta-carotene ranges from 8.7% to 65% [ 19 , 22 ].\n",
    "Vitamin A Intakes and Status": "Average daily intakes of vitamin A from foods and beverages in the United States were 682 mcg RAE for men age 20 and older and 616 mcg RAE for women in 2017–2018, according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) [ 23 ]. For children age 2–19, mean daily intakes of vitamin A from foods and beverages ranged from 497 to 680 mcg RAE. An analysis of biochemical data from 2003–2006 NHANES data indicates that less than 1% of the U.S. population has a serum retinol level of less than 20 mcg/dL, which indicates that vitamin A deficiency is uncommon in the U.S. population [ 24 ].\nData from NHANES III, conducted from 1988 to 1994, showed that approximately 26% of the vitamin A in RAEs consumed by men and 34% of that consumed by women in the United States comes from provitamin A carotenoids [ 5 ]. The remainder comes from preformed vitamin A, mostly in the form of retinyl esters.\nAbout 12% to 40% of the U.S. population, depending on age, uses supplements containing vitamin A [ 25 ]. Adults age 71 years or older and children younger than 9 are more likely than members of other age groups to take supplements containing vitamin A.\n",
    "Vitamin A Deficiency": "Frank vitamin A deficiency is rare in the United States. However, vitamin A deficiency is still common in many developing countries, often as a result of limited access to foods containing preformed vitamin A from animal-based food sources and to foods containing provitamin A carotenoids because of poverty or traditional diets [ 1 , 26 ]. A pooled analysis of population-based surveys from 138 low-income and middle-income countries found that 29% of children age 6 months to 5 years had vitamin A deficiency in 2013 [ 27 ]. Deficiency rates were highest in sub-Saharan Africa (48%) and South Asia (44%). In addition, approximately 10% to 20% of pregnant women in low-income countries have vitamin A deficiency [ 28 ].\nLimited research suggests that vitamin A deficiency may also be influenced by genetic variability in conversion rates of beta-carotene to vitamin A. Certain polymorphisms in the BCMO1 gene have been found to reduce the activity of the BCMO1 enzyme in humans [ 8 , 9 ], and a study in the Philippines among 693 children and adolescents found an inverse association between vitamin A status and the A379V TT variant in the BCMO1 gene [ 7 ].\nThe most common clinical sign of vitamin A deficiency is xerophthalmia, which develops after plasma retinol has been low and the eye’s vitamin A reserves have become depleted. The first sign is night blindness, or the inability to see in low light or darkness as a result of low rhodopsin levels in the retina [ 1 , 27 , 28 ]. Xerophthalmia also affects the cornea and can eventually lead to permanent blindness; vitamin A deficiency is one of the top causes of preventable blindness in children [ 28 ].\nChronic vitamin A deficiency has also been associated with abnormal lung development, respiratory diseases (such as pneumonia), and an increased risk of anemia and death [ 26 , 27 , 29 ].\nAnother effect of chronic vitamin A deficiency is increased severity and mortality risk of infections (particularly measles and infection-associated diarrhea) [ 26 ]. In 2013, 94,500 children in low-income and middle-income countries died of diarrhea and 11,200 died of measles as a result of vitamin A deficiency [ 27 ]. More than 95% of deaths attributable to vitamin A deficiency occurred in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, where vitamin A deficiency was responsible for 2% of all deaths in children younger than 5 years [ 27 ].\n",
    "Groups at Risk of Vitamin A Inadequacy": "The following groups are among those most likely to have inadequate intakes of vitamin A.\n",
    "Premature infants": "Preterm infants have low liver stores of vitamin A at birth, and their plasma concentrations of retinol often remain low throughout the first year of life [ 30 , 31 ]. Preterm infants with vitamin A deficiency have a higher risk of eye and chronic lung diseases [ 32 , 33 ]. However, in high-income countries, clinical vitamin A deficiency is rare in infants and occurs only in those with malabsorption disorders [ 34 ].\n",
    "Infants, children, and pregnant and lactating women in low-income and middle-income countries": "Pregnant women need extra vitamin A for fetal growth and tissue maintenance and to support their own metabolism [ 35-37 ]. The breast milk of lactating women with adequate vitamin A intakes contains sufficient amounts of vitamin A to meet infants’ needs for the first 6 months of life [ 38 ]. However, in people with vitamin A deficiency, the vitamin A content of breast milk is not sufficient to maintain adequate vitamin A stores in infants who are exclusively breastfed [ 38 ].\nAbout 190 million preschool-age children (one-third of all children in this age group), mostly in Africa and Southeast Asia, have vitamin A deficiency, according to the World Health Organization [ 27 , 39 ]. They have a higher risk of visual impairment and of illness and death from childhood infections, such as measles and infections that cause diarrheal diseases [ 1 , 39 ].\nThe World Health Organization estimates that 9.8 million pregnant women (15% of all pregnant women) around the world, mostly in low-income and middle-income countries, have xerophthalmia as a result of vitamin A deficiency [ 40 ].\n",
    "People with cystic fibrosis": "Up to 90% of people with cystic fibrosis have pancreatic insufficiency, which increases their risk of vitamin A deficiency due to difficulty absorbing fat [ 1 , 41 ]. Studies in Australia and the Netherlands indicate that 2% to 13% of children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis have vitamin A deficiency [ 42 , 43 ]. As a result, standard care for cystic fibrosis includes lifelong treatment with vitamin A (daily amounts of 750 mcg RAE to 3,000 mcg RAE, depending on age, are recommended in the United States and Australia), other fat-soluble vitamins, and pancreatic enzymes [ 41 , 43 ].\n",
    "Individuals with gastrointestinal disorders": "Approximately one-quarter of children with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis have vitamin A deficiency; adults with these disorders, especially those who have had the disorder for several years, also have a higher risk of vitamin A deficiency [ 44 , 45 ]. Although some evidence supports the use of vitamin A supplements in people with these disorders [ 46 ], other research has found that supplementation offers no benefit [ 47 ]. Some children and adults with newly diagnosed celiac disease also have vitamin A deficiency; a gluten-free diet can, but does not always, eliminate this deficiency [ 48-51 ].\n",
    "Vitamin A and Health": "This section focuses on three diseases and disorders in which vitamin A or carotenoids might play a role: cancer, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and measles.\n",
    "Cancer": "Because of its role in regulating cell growth and differentiation, several studies have examined the association between vitamin A and various types of cancer. However, the relationship between serum vitamin A levels or vitamin A supplementation and cancer risk or cancer-related death is unclear. This fact sheet does not include studies of all-trans retinoic acid, a vitamin A metabolite that is used as a drug in high doses to treat a form of leukemia [ 52 , 53 ].\nSeveral systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies have shown that higher dietary intakes of retinol, carotenoids, fruits and vegetables, or a combination are associated with a lower risk of lung cancer [ 54 ], non-Hodgkin lymphoma [ 55 ], pancreatic cancer [ 56 ], oral cavity cancer [ 57 ], laryngeal cancer [ 57 ], esophageal cancer [ 58 ], ovarian cancer [ 59 , 60 ], glioma [ 61 ], and bladder cancer [ 62 ]. However, other observational studies have found no association between intakes of different forms of vitamin A and risk of liver cancer [ 63 ], non-Hodgkin lymphoma [ 64 ], colorectal cancer [ 65 ], prostate cancer [ 65 ], or all cancers [ 66 ].\nSome clinical trial evidence suggests that supplemental vitamin A might reduce the risk of certain cancers but increase the risk of other forms of cancer, cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality, and all-cause mortality. Examples are provided below.\nThe Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) included 18,314 male and female current and former smokers (with at least a 20 pack-year history [equivalent to smoking 1 pack per day for 20 years or 2 packs per day for 10 years, for example] of cigarette smoking) as well as some men occupationally exposed to asbestos (who also have a higher risk of lung cancer), all age 45–74 years. The study randomized participants to take supplements containing 30 mg beta-carotene plus 25,000 IU (7,500 mcg RAE) retinyl palmitate or a placebo daily for about 6 years to evaluate the potential effects on lung cancer risk [ 67 ]. The trial was ended prematurely after a mean of 4 years, partly because the supplements were unexpectedly found to have increased lung cancer risk by 28% and death from lung cancer by 46%; the supplements also increased the risk of all-cause mortality by 17%.\nA subsequent study followed CARET participants for an additional 6 years after they stopped taking the study supplements [ 68 ]. During this time, the differences in lung cancer risk between the intervention and placebo groups were no longer statistically significant, with one exception: women in the intervention group had a 33% higher risk of lung cancer. In a separate analysis of CARET study data, men who took the two supplements had a 35% lower risk of nonaggressive prostate cancer during the 4-year active trial but not during the 6-year postintervention period. In contrast, men who took these two supplements in addition to another self-prescribed supplement (typically a multivitamin) had a 52% higher risk of aggressive prostate cancer during the active trial, but not during the postintervention period [ 69 ].\nThe Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene (ATBC) Cancer Prevention Study also found that beta-carotene supplements increased the risk of lung cancer in smokers [ 70 ]. In this study, 29,133 male smokers age 50–69 years who smoked an average of 20.4 cigarettes a day for an average of 35.9 years took a supplement containing 50 mg/day alpha-tocopherol, 20 mg/day beta-carotene, both alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene, or a placebo for 5–8 years. The beta-carotene supplements increased the risk of lung cancer by 18%, although they had little to no effect on the incidence of other cancers. The overall rate of death, primarily from lung cancer and ischemic heart disease, was 8% higher in participants who took beta-carotene. A subsequent study followed 25,563 of these participants for an additional 18 years [ 71 ]. During this period, participants were no longer taking the supplements, but most continued to smoke. Participants who had taken beta-carotene in the original trial did not have a higher risk of lung cancer, but they had a 20% higher risk of death due to prostate cancer.\nThe Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) was a 5-year randomized clinical trial with 4,203 participants age 50–85 years examining the effects on AMD of a dietary supplement containing several ingredients with or without beta-carotene (15 mg [7,500 mcg RAE]) [ 72 ]. No current smokers received the supplements containing beta-carotene. At the end of the trial, more lung cancers were discovered in the beta-carotene group than in the no beta-carotene group (23 vs. 11 cases), and 31 of the 34 affected were former smokers. In a follow-up analysis of 3,882 of the participants 5 years after the end of AREDS2 (during which they took the AREDS2 formulation containing lutein and zeaxanthin instead of beta-carotene), the increased lung cancer risk persisted, with an 82% higher risk among participants who took the supplement containing beta-carotene during the 5-year AREDS2 trial [ 73 ].\nThree other clinical trials have found no relationship between taking vitamin A or beta-carotene supplements and lung cancer incidence or mortality [ 74 ]. One trial randomized 22,071 male physicians age 40–84 years to take 50 mg beta carotene on alternate days or a placebo for 12 years [ 75 ]. Eleven percent of the physicians were current smokers, and 38% were former smokers at the start of the study. The results showed no differences between the groups in number of cases of lung cancer or any malignant neoplasms or number of deaths from cancer. Another trial randomized 7,627 women (mean age 60.4 years) to take 50 mg beta-carotene on alternate days, 600 IU vitamin E on alternate days, 500 mg vitamin C daily, or a placebo for a mean of 9.4 years [ 76 ]. Fifteen percent of the women were current smokers, and 41% were former smokers at the start of the study. None of the supplements had any significant effect on total cancer incidence or cancer mortality, including from lung cancer. A third trial included 29,584 healthy men and women age 40–69 years who were living in Linxian, China, where micronutrient deficiencies are common [ 77 ]. The study randomized participants to take either a placebo or one of four vitamin and mineral combinations (including one providing retinol and zinc and another providing beta carotene, vitamin E, and selenium) for 5.25 years. The investigators followed participants for an additional 10 years after they stopped taking the supplements. The nutrient doses in the supplements were equivalent to or twice as high as U.S. recommended intakes, but the study report did not provide the exact doses. During both the intervention and follow-up periods, lung cancer death rates did not differ among the five groups, even when the investigators further analyzed the results for differences by age, sex, and smoking status.\nThe CARET and ATBC study results suggest that large supplemental doses of beta-carotene with or without retinyl palmitate have detrimental effects in current or former smokers and workers exposed to asbestos. However, the other studies described above that used similar vitamin A doses but had smaller proportions of current or former smokers do not raise this concern. Among nonsmokers, beta-carotene and vitamin A supplements do not appear to affect the risk of cancer.\n",
    "Age-related macular degeneration": "AMD is the leading cause of significant vision loss in older people [ 78 ]. AMD’s etiology involves complex interactions among genetic susceptibility, environmental factors (including exposure to oxidative stress), and normal aging [ 78 ]. Because of the role of oxidative stress in AMD pathophysiology, supplements containing carotenoids with antioxidant functions, such as beta-carotene, lutein, and zeaxanthin, might be useful for preventing or treating this condition. Lutein and zeaxanthin (which are not precursors of vitamin A), in particular, accumulate in the retina, the tissue in the eye that is damaged by AMD.\nThe AREDS trial found that participants with a high risk of developing advanced AMD (i.e., those who had intermediate AMD or who had advanced AMD in one eye) had a 25% lower risk of developing advanced AMD after they took a daily supplement containing beta-carotene (15 mg [7,500 mcg RAE]), vitamin E (180 mg [400 IU] dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate), vitamin C (500 mg), zinc (80 mg), and copper (2 mg) for 5 years than participants taking a placebo [ 79 ].\nThe follow-up AREDS2 study confirmed the value of this supplement in reducing the progression of AMD over a median follow-up period of 5 years [ 72 ]. However, this follow-up study showed that adding lutein (10 mg) and zeaxanthin (2 mg) or omega-3 fatty acids to the formulation produced no additional benefits. Importantly, the follow-up study also revealed that beta-carotene was not a required ingredient; the original AREDS formulation without beta-carotene provided the same protective effect against developing advanced AMD.\nIn a more detailed analysis, participants with the lowest dietary intakes of lutein and zeaxanthin had a 26% lower risk of advanced AMD when they took a supplement containing these two carotenoids than those who did not take a supplement with these carotenoids [ 72 ]. The risk of advanced AMD was also 18% lower in participants who took the modified AREDS supplement containing lutein and zeaxanthin but not beta-carotene than in participants who took the formulation with beta-carotene but not lutein or zeaxanthin.\nA subsequent study monitored dietary intakes of several nutrients in 4,504 AREDS participants and 3,738 AREDS2 participants (mean age 71 years) for a median of 10.2 years [ 80 ]. Participants in the two highest quintiles of intakes for vitamin A, beta-carotene, or lutein and zeaxanthin had a lower risk of progression to late AMD. For example, the risk of late AMD was 18% lower among those in the fifth quintile for vitamin A intake and 20% lower among those in the fourth quintile than among those in the first quintile.\nAt the end of the 5-year AREDS2 trial, participants were all offered the final AREDS2 formulation that included lutein and zeaxanthin in place of beta-carotene. Researchers followed up with 3,882 of these participants for an additional 5 years [ 73 ]. After 10 years, participants who had taken the AREDS2 supplement with lutein and zeaxanthin had an additional 20% reduced risk of progression to late AMD compared with those who took the supplement containing beta-carotene. This finding confirmed the benefit of replacing beta-carotene with lutein and zeaxanthin.\nIndividuals who have or are developing AMD should talk to their health care provider about their vitamin A intakes and the supplement formulations used in the AREDS studies.\n",
    "Measles": "In 2023, measles was responsible for about 107,500 deaths worldwide, mostly in young children in low-income countries [ 81 , 82 ]. Vitamin A deficiency, which is rare in the United States, is a risk factor for severe measles [ 27 , 83 ]. A World Health Organization analysis of data from 83 countries showed that 11,200 child deaths from measles were associated with vitamin A deficiency in 2013, and more than 95% of these deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia [ 27 ].\nResearch suggests that vitamin A supplementation reduces the risk of measles in children who are at high risk of vitamin A deficiency. However, vitamin A supplementation does not appear to reduce the risk of death from measles. A 2022 Cochrane Review included six clinical trials that examined the effect of vitamin A supplementation on the risk of measles in children [ 84 ]. These studies enrolled a total of 19,566 children age 6 months to 5 years who lived in low- and middle-income countries. Vitamin A doses ranged from 15,000 mcg RAE (50,000 IU) to 60,000 mcg RAE (200,000 IU), depending on age. Supplements were administered as a single dose or every 4 to 6 months. Vitamin A supplementation reduced the risk of new cases of measles by 50%. However, the same Cochrane Review found that vitamin A supplementation did not affect the risk of death due to measles, based on the results from six clinical trials in a total of 1,088,261 children.\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Vitamin A": "Because vitamin A is fat soluble, the body stores excess amounts, primarily in the liver, and these levels can accumulate.\nAcute vitamin A toxicity, also referred to as hypervitaminosis A, occurs within days to weeks after someone ingests one or a few very high doses (typically more than 100 times the RDA) [ 85 ]. Resulting signs and symptoms typically include severe headache, blurred vision, nausea, dizziness, aching muscles, and coordination problems. In severe cases, cerebral spinal fluid pressure can increase, leading to drowsiness and, eventually, coma and even death [ 85 ].\nChronic hypervitaminosis A (regular consumption of high doses) can cause dry skin, painful muscles and joints, fatigue, depression, and abnormal liver test results [ 85 ].\nTotal intakes of preformed vitamin A that exceed the UL as well as some retinoid medications used as topical therapies (such as isotretinoin, used to treat severe acne, and etretinate, a treatment for severe psoriasis) can cause congenital birth defects [ 1 ]. These birth defects can include malformations of the eye, skull, lungs, and heart [ 14 ]. Experts advise women who are or might be pregnant and those who are lactating not to take high doses (more than 3,000 mcg RAE [10,000 IU] daily) of vitamin A supplements [ 1 ].\nUnlike preformed vitamin A, beta-carotene is not known to be teratogenic or lead to reproductive toxicity [ 1 ]. The most common effect of long-term, excess beta-carotene is carotenodermia, a harmless condition in which the skin becomes yellow-orange [ 3 ]. This condition can be reversed by discontinuing beta-carotene ingestion. However, the ATBC trial found that supplementation with a large amount of beta-carotene (20 mg/day), with or without 50 mg/day vitamin E, for 5–8 years increased the risk of lung cancer and mortality (mainly from lung cancer and ischemic heart disease) in male smokers [ 70 ]. The CARET trial also showed that supplementation with a large amount of beta-carotene (30 mg/day) plus 7,500 mcg RAE (25,000 IU)/day retinyl palmitate for 4–8 years in current and former smokers as well as some men occupationally exposed to asbestos increased the risk of lung cancer and death from lung cancer [ 67 ].\nThe FNB has not established ULs for beta-carotene and other provitamin A carotenoids [ 3 ]. However, the FNB advises against the use of beta-carotene supplements for the general population, except as a provitamin A source to prevent vitamin A deficiency.\n",
    "Tolerable upper intake levels for preformed vitamin A": "The FNB has established ULs for preformed vitamin A that apply to both food and supplement intakes [ 5 ]. The FNB based these ULs on the amounts associated with an increased risk of liver abnormalities in men and women, teratogenic effects, and several toxic effects in infants and children.\n*These ULs apply only to products from animal sources and supplements whose vitamin A comes entirely from retinol or its ester forms, such as retinyl palmitate. However, many dietary supplements (such as multivitamins) do not provide all of their vitamin A in retinol or its ester forms. For example, the vitamin A in some supplements consists partly or entirely of beta-carotene. In such cases, the percentage of retinol or retinyl ester in the supplement should be used to determine whether an individual’s vitamin A intake exceeds the UL. For example, a supplement whose label indicates that the product contains 3,000 mcg RAE vitamin A and that 60% of this vitamin A comes from beta-carotene (and therefore 40% comes from retinol or retinyl ester) provides 1,200 mcg RAE of preformed vitamin A. That amount is above the UL for children from birth to 8 years but below the UL for older children and adults.\n",
    "Interactions with Medications": "Vitamin A has the potential to interact with certain medications. In addition, several types of medications might adversely affect vitamin A levels. A few examples are provided below. Individuals taking these and other medications on a regular basis should discuss their vitamin A status with their health care providers.\nOrlistat (Alli, Xenical), a weight-loss treatment, can decrease the absorption of vitamin A, other fat-soluble vitamins, and beta-carotene, resulting in low plasma levels in some patients [ 86 , 87 ]. The manufacturers of Alli and Xenical recommend that patients on orlistat take a multivitamin supplement containing vitamin A and beta-carotene as well as other fat-soluble vitamins [ 88 , 89 ].\n",
    "Retinoids": "Several synthetic retinoids derived from vitamin A are used orally as prescription medicines. Examples include the psoriasis treatment acitretin (Soriatane) and bexarotene (Targretin), used to treat the skin effects of T-cell lymphoma. Retinoids can increase the risk of hypervitaminosis A when taken in combination with vitamin A supplements [ 87 ].\n",
    "Vitamin A and Healthful Diets": "The federal government’s 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate .\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy eating pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products, and oils. Many fruits, vegetables, and dairy products are good sources of vitamin A. Some ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are fortified with vitamin A. Includes a variety of protein foods, including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans and peas), nuts, seeds, and soy products. Beef liver contains high amounts of vitamin A. Other sources of the nutrient include eggs and some fish. Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Limits alcoholic beverages. Stays within your daily calorie needs.\nMany fruits, vegetables, and dairy products are good sources of vitamin A.

    "Vitamin/Mineral": "Biotin",
    "Table of Contents": "Introduction Recommended Intakes Sources of Biotin Biotin Intakes and Status Biotin Deficiency Groups at Risk of Biotin Inadequacy Biotin and Health Health Risks from Excessive Biotin Interactions with Laboratory Tests Interactions with Medications Biotin and Healthful Diets References Disclaimer\nThis is a fact sheet intended for health professionals.  For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet .\n",
    "Introduction": "Biotin, a B vitamin, is an essential nutrient that is naturally present in some foods and available as a dietary supplement. This water-soluble vitamin is a cofactor for five carboxylases (propionyl-CoA carboxylase, pyruvate carboxylase, methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase [MCC], acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2) that catalyze critical steps in the metabolism of fatty acids, glucose, and amino acids [ 1-5 ]. Biotin also plays key roles in histone modifications, gene regulation (by modifying the activity of transcription factors), and cell signaling [ 3 ].\nMost biotin in foods is bound to protein, although some dietary biotin is in the free form [ 1 , 3 , 4 , 6 ]. Gastrointestinal proteases and peptidases break down the protein-bound forms of ingested biotin into biocytin and biotin-oligopeptides, which undergo further processing by biotinidase, an enzyme, in the intestinal lumen to release free biotin [ 6 ]. The free biotin is then absorbed in the small intestine, and most biotin is stored in the liver [ 1 , 3 , 6 ].\nA limited number of reliable indicators of biotin status is available [ 7 ]. In healthy adults, the concentration of biotin is 133–329 pmol/L in serum and 18–127 nmol/24 hours in urine [ 2 ]. Abnormally low urinary excretion of biotin is an indicator of biotin deficiency, as is abnormally high excretion of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid (higher than 3.3 mmol/mol creatinine) or 3-hydroxyisovalerylcarnitine (higher than 0.06 mmol/mol creatinine) resulting from reduced activity of MCC [ 2 , 7 , 8 ]. The most reliable individual markers of biotin status, including deficiency and sufficiency, are biotinylated MCC and propionyl-CoA carboxylase in white blood cells [ 7 ]. Oral administration of large doses of biotin increases serum concentrations of biotin and its metabolites [ 1 , 9 ]. However, serum concentrations of biotin and its catabolites are not good indicators of marginal biotin deficiency because they do not decrease sufficiently in people with marginal biotin deficiency for these changes to be detectable with existing tests [ 3 , 10 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for biotin and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [ 1 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nThe FNB found the available data to be insufficient to derive an EAR and RDA for biotin. For this reason, the FNB established only AIs for biotin. The FNB based its determination of AIs for all populations on the amount of biotin in human milk consumed by infants and then used body weight to extrapolate AIs for other groups [ 11 ]. Table 1 lists the current AIs for biotin [ 1 ].\n",
    "Food": "Many foods contain some biotin. Foods that contain the most biotin include organ meats, eggs, fish, meat, seeds, nuts, and certain vegetables (such as sweet potatoes) [ 2 , 12 ]. The biotin content of food can vary; for example, plant variety and season can affect the biotin content of cereal grains, and certain processing techniques (e.g., canning) can reduce the biotin content of foods [ 12 ].\nDietary avidin, a glycoprotein in raw egg whites, binds tightly to dietary biotin and prevents biotin’s absorption in the gastrointestinal tract [ 13 , 14 ]. Cooking denatures avidin, making it unable to interfere with biotin absorption [ 13 ].\nSeveral food sources of biotin are listed in Table 2.\n*DV = Daily Value. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for biotin is 30 mcg for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 15 ]. FDA does not require food labels to list biotin content unless biotin has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) FoodData Central does not list the biotin content of foods or provide lists of foods containing biotin.\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "Biotin is available in dietary supplements containing biotin only, in supplements containing combinations of B-complex vitamins, and in some multivitamin/mineral products [ 16 ]. The absorption rate of oral, free biotin is 100%, even when people consume pharmacologic doses of up to 20 mg/day biotin [ 17 ].\n",

    "Tolerable upper intake levels for preformed vitamin A": NaN,
    "Interactions with Medications": "Biotin can interact with certain medications, and some medications can have an adverse effect on biotin levels. One example is provided below. Individuals taking this and other medications on a regular basis should discuss their biotin status with their health care providers.\n",
    "Retinoids": NaN,
    "Vitamin A and Healthful Diets": NaN,
    "Biotin Intakes and Status": "Although there are no nationally representative estimates of biotin intakes in the United States, the average biotin intake from foods in other western populations is about 35–70 mcg/day, indicating that most people in these countries consume adequate amounts of biotin [ 2 , 3 ].\n",
    "Biotin Deficiency": "Biotin deficiency is rare [ 12 , 18 ], and severe biotin deficiency in healthy individuals eating a normal mixed diet has never been reported [ 13 ].\nThe signs and symptoms of biotin deficiency typically appear gradually and can include thinning hair with progression to loss of all hair on the body; scaly, red rash around body openings (eyes, nose, mouth, and perineum); conjunctivitis; ketolactic acidosis (which occurs when lactate production exceeds lactate clearance) and aciduria (abnormal amounts of acid in urine); seizures; skin infection; brittle nails; neurological findings (e.g., depression, lethargy, hallucinations, and paresthesias of the extremities) in adults; and hypotonia, lethargy, and developmental delay in infants [ 2 , 3 , 13 ]. The rash and unusual distribution of facial fat in people with biotin deficiency is known as biotin deficiency facies [ 1 , 13 ].\n",
    "Groups at Risk of Biotin Inadequacy": "The following groups are among those most likely to have inadequate biotin status.\n",
    "Individuals with biotinidase deficiency": "Biotinidase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that prevents the body from releasing free biotin, leading to biotin deficiency despite normal intake. Without treatment, biotinidase deficiency produces neurological and cutaneous symptoms, and profound biotinidase deficiency can lead to coma or death [ 19 , 20 ]. Because treatment with oral biotin starting at birth (or before symptoms develop) and continuing for the rest of the person’s life can prevent these symptoms, all newborns in the United States and many other countries are screened for this disorder [ 19 , 20 ].\n",
    "Individuals with chronic alcohol exposure": "Chronic exposure to alcohol inhibits the absorption of biotin [ 21 ]. Plasma biotin concentrations are low in 15% of people with chronic alcoholism [ 12 ].\n",
    "Pregnant and breastfeeding women": "At least a third of pregnant women develop marginal biotin deficiency in spite of normal biotin intakes; plasma and breastmilk concentrations of biotin decrease in lactating women, even when their dietary biotin intakes exceed the AI [ 2 , 18 , 22 ]. Additional research is needed to understand the clinical significance of these findings.\n",
    "Hair, nail, and skin health": "Signs of biotin deficiency include skin rashes, hair loss, and brittle nails [ 10 , 13 ]. Therefore, biotin supplements are often promoted for hair, skin, and nail health [ 16 , 23 , 24 ]. However, these claims are supported, at best, by only a few case reports and small studies.\nThe evidence on biotin supplementation to treat brittle nails includes three small studies that did not include a placebo group, and these reports do not indicate the baseline biotin status of study participants. One of these studies assessed the effects of 2.5 mg/day biotin for 6–15 months in 22 women with brittle, splitting, or soft nails and 10 healthy volunteers [ 25 ]. In the eight patients with brittle nails whose nail samples were obtained immediately before and after biotin supplementation, nail thickness increased by 25%. In the 14 patients with brittle nails whose nail specimens were obtained 2–4 months after starting treatment and 1–4 months after ending treatment, nail thickness increased by 7%, a difference that was not statistically significant. In the second study, 2.5 mg biotin daily for an average of 5.5 months in 45 patients with thin and brittle fingernails resulted in firmer and harder fingernails in 41 of the patients (91%) [ 26 ]. Finally, the third, retrospective study in 35 patients with brittle nails found that 2.5 mg/day biotin for 6–15 months resulted in clinical improvement in 22 of the 35 patients (63%) [ 27 ].\nOnly case reports are available to support claims that biotin supplements can promote hair health, and these reports were only in children [ 28 , 29 ]. These studies found that 3–5 mg/day biotin in children with uncombable hair syndrome (a rare disorder of the hair shaft) significantly improved hair health after 3–4 months. The evidence supporting the use of biotin supplements to support skin health is equally limited to a small number of case reports, all in infants, showing that 100 mcg to 10 mg/day resulted in dramatic improvements in rash or dermatitis as well as alopecia [ 30 , 31 ].\nFuture studies are needed to determine whether biotin supplements might improve hair, nail, and skin health, especially among healthy individuals.\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Biotin": "The FNB was unable to establish ULs for biotin because there is no evidence in humans that biotin is toxic at high intakes [ 1 ]. Several studies have found no adverse effects of 10–50 mg/day biotin, and up to 200 mg/day oral biotin or 20 mg/day intravenously in patients with biotinidase deficiency do not produce symptoms of toxicity [ 1 , 10 ].\nHigh biotin intakes, and potentially even intakes greater than the AI, may pose another type of health risk [ 32 ]. Supplementing with biotin beyond recommended intakes can cause clinically significant falsely high or falsely low laboratory test results, depending on the test. These incorrect results may lead to inappropriate patient management or misdiagnosis of a medical condition. The following section has more details on these interactions.\n",
    "Interactions with Laboratory Tests": "Very high intakes of biotin may interfere with diagnostic assays that use biotin-streptavidin technology and are commonly used to measure levels of hormones (such as thyroid hormone) and other analytes such as 25-hydroxyvitamin D, producing falsely normal or abnormal results [ 9 , 32 ]. As a result, a few recent case reports have described findings falsely indicating Graves' disease and severe hyperthyroidism in patients taking 10–300 mg biotin per day, including six children receiving high doses of biotin (2–15 mg/kg body weight per day) to treat inherited metabolic diseases [ 33-37 ].\nEven a single 10 mg dose of biotin has interfered with thyroid function tests administered within 24 hours of taking the supplement [ 38 ]. A small study in six healthy adults who took 10 mg/day of supplemental biotin for 1 week found interference in several biotinylated assays, including falsely decreased levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (which could lead to a misdiagnosis of thyrotoxicosis) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (which could result in a failure to identify congestive heart failure) [ 9 ]. According to FDA, a patient with a high intake of supplemental biotin died following a troponin test (to help diagnose a heart attack) that gave a falsely low result because the test was subject to biotin interference [ 32 ].\nFDA advises health care providers to ask their patients about any supplements they may be taking that contain biotin and to consider biotin interference as a possible source of error if laboratory test results do not match the clinical presentation of the patient [ 32 ].\n",
    "Anticonvulsants": "In a study in 264 people with epilepsy, anticonvulsant treatment for at least 1 year was associated with significantly lower serum biotin levels than in control group patients [ 39 ]. The anticonvulsants used included carbamazepine (Tegretol, Carbatrol, Epitol, Equetro), primidone (Mysoline), phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek), and phenobarbital (Luminal, Solfoton) as well as combinations of these medications. A few other, smaller studies have found similar results [ 40 , 41 ]. The reason could be that anticonvulsant treatment increases biotin catabolism, which leads to reduced biotin status and inhibition of intestinal biotin absorption [ 40 , 42 ].\n",
    "Biotin and Healthful Diets": "The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Some fruits, vegetables, dairy products, and whole grains contain biotin. Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. ​​​​​​​Eggs and some organ meats are good sources of biotin; many nuts, seeds, seafood, and lean meats contain biotin. Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Limits alcoholic beverages. Stays within your daily calorie needs.\nSome fruits, vegetables, dairy products, and whole grains contain biotin.\n​​​​​​​Eggs and some organ meats are good sources of biotin; many nuts, seeds, seafood, and lean meats contain biotin.\n",

    "Introduction": "Boron is a trace element that is naturally present in many foods and available as a dietary supplement. It is a structural component of plant cell walls and is required for plant growth, pollination, and seed formation [ 1 ].\nBoron is not classified as an essential nutrient for humans because research has not yet identified a clear biological function for boron [ 2 ]. However, it might have beneficial effects on such functions as reproduction and development, calcium metabolism, bone formation, brain function, insulin and energy substrate metabolism, immunity, and the function of steroid hormones (including vitamin D and estrogen) [ 1-14 ].\nBoron is present in foods and beverages as inorganic borates as well as mono- or di-sugar-borate esters, such as calcium fructoborate [ 14 , 15 ]. Most ingested boron is hydrolyzed to boric acid within the gastrointestinal tract [ 6 ]. The body absorbs about 85%–90% of ingested boron [ 2 , 4 ]. However, very little is known about how or where in the gastrointestinal tract absorption occurs [ 8 ].\nBoron does not accumulate in most body tissues, but bone, nails, and hair have higher boron levels than other body tissues, whereas fat has lower levels [ 9 ]. Boric acid is the main form of boron in blood, urine, and other body fluids [ 2 , 4 , 7 ]. The lack of substantial changes in blood boron levels in response to large increases in dietary intakes suggests that the body maintains boron homeostasis, likely by increasing urinary excretion, but the regulatory mechanisms for boron homeostasis have not been identified [ 6 ]. Boron is excreted mainly in the urine, and small amounts are excreted in the feces, sweat, breath, and bile [ 9 , 10 ].\nBoron status is not routinely measured in clinical practice. Most studies suggest that urinary boron levels correlate with boron intakes [ 2 , 4 , 16 , 17 ]. Fasting plasma concentrations of boron in postmenopausal women range from 34 to 95 ng/mL (3.14 to 8.79 mcmol/L) [ 4 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by an expert committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [ 2 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nThe FNB found the existing data insufficient to derive an RDA, AI, or EAR for boron [ 2 ]. The World Health Organization estimates that an acceptable safe range of boron intakes for adults is 1–13 mg/day [ 8 ].\n",
    "Food": "Plant foods—including fruit, tubers, and legumes—contain the largest amounts of boron [ 2 , 6 , 15 , 18 , 19 ]. Wine, cider, and beer also contain boron [ 8 ].\nThe main sources of boron in the diets of people in the United States are coffee, milk, apples, dried and cooked beans, and potatoes, primarily because people tend to consume large amounts of these foods [ 7 , 15 ]. Among toddlers, 38% of boron intakes comes from fruits and fruit juices and 19% from milk and cheese [ 6 , 20 ]. For adolescents, milk and cheese products account for 18%–20% of boron intakes, whereas beverages, especially instant coffee, represent the largest dietary source of boron for adults [ 6 ].\nThe amount of boron in plant foods depends somewhat on the boron content of the soil and water where they were grown [ 7 , 21 ]. Areas of the world with limited boron in the soil include Brazil, Japan, and most of the United States, mainly because of high levels of rainfall, which leaches boron out of the soil [ 21 ]. In contrast, arid regions of the world—including California and parts of Turkey, Argentina, Chile, Russia, China, and Peru—have higher boron concentrations [ 21 , 22 ].\nBoron concentrations are about 0.27 mg/L in breast milk and 0.33 mg/L in cow’s milk [ 23 ]. Water contains boron, but the concentration varies considerably by source [ 19 ]. The median boron concentration of drinking water in the United States is 0.031 mg/L [ 24 ].\nSelected food sources of boron are listed in Table 1. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) FoodData Central [ 25 ] does not list the boron content of foods or provide lists of foods containing boron. Therefore, information on boron levels in foods is limited.\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "Boron is available in dietary supplements containing only boron and in supplements containing boron in combination with a few other nutrients, often other minerals. Common amounts of elemental boron in dietary supplements range from 0.15 to 6 mg [ 27 ].\nIn dietary supplements, boron is present in many different forms, including sodium borate, sodium tetraborate, boron amino acid chelate, boron ascorbate, boron aspartate, boron citrate, boron gluconate, boron glycinate, boron picolinate, and calcium fructoborate [ 6 , 27 ]. In a small human study, boron as sodium tetraborate significantly increased plasma boron levels within 4–6 hours of consumption [ 5 ], but no data are available on the relative bioavailability of different forms of supplemental boron.\nThe Supplement Facts label on a dietary supplement product declares the amount of elemental boron in the product, not the weight of the entire boron-containing compound.\n",

    "Cancer": "Preliminary evidence suggests that dietary boron intake might affect cancer risk. Several observational studies found that boron intakes are inversely associated with prostate cancer risk in men and with lung and cervical cancer risk in women [ 1 , 9 , 41-44 ]. For example, in a case control study of 763 women with lung cancer and 838 healthy women, those in the lowest quartile of boron intake (less than 0.78 mg/day) had almost twice the risk of lung cancer of those in the highest quartile (more than 1.25 mg/day) [ 44 ]. An observational study in Turkey evaluated two criteria for prostate cancer risk, prostate size and prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels. Men with higher boron intakes (about 6 mg/day) had significantly smaller prostate glands than men who consumed less boron (0.64–0.88 mg/day) [ 45 ]. However, PSA levels did not differ significantly between the two groups.\nNo clinical trials have evaluated the effects of boron on cancer prevention or treatment. More research is needed to understand the effects, if any, of boron on cancer.\n",

    "Boron Intakes and Status": "According to data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III; 1988–1994) and the Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (1994–1996), median dietary boron intakes range from 0.87 to 1.35 mg/day in adults, 1.05 to 1.08 mg/day in pregnant women, and 0.75 to 0.96 mg/day in school-age children [ 2 ]. Vegetarians tend to have higher intakes of boron than nonvegetarians because boron is plentiful in plant foods [ 15 ]. The median dietary boron intake in lactating women is 1.27 mg/day [ 2 ]. Boron intakes are about 0.55 mg/day among infants and about 0.54 mg/day among toddlers [ 6 ].\nTotal median boron intakes from dietary supplements and foods are about 1.0 to 1.5 mg/day for adults [ 2 ].\n",
    "Boron Deficiency": "In humans, boron deficiency signs and symptoms have not been firmly established. Limited data suggest that boron deficiency might affect brain function by reducing mental alertness and impairing executive brain function [ 1 , 8 , 28 ]. In addition, a low-boron diet (0.25 mg boron/2,000 kcal) might elevate urinary calcium and magnesium excretion and lower serum concentrations of estrogen in postmenopausal women [ 8 , 29 ]. Low boron intakes (0.23 mg boron/2,000 kcal) also appear to reduce plasma calcium and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and raise serum calcitonin and osteocalcin levels in men and women [ 8 ]; these changes could affect bone mineral density.\n",
    "Boron and Health": "This section focuses on three health areas in which boron might be involved: osteoarthritis, bone health, and cancer.\n",
    "Osteoarthritis": "Observational evidence combined with the findings from a few small clinical studies in humans suggests that boron might be helpful for reducing the symptoms of osteoarthritis, possibly by inhibiting inflammation [ 3 , 30-33 ].\nIn a small pilot study that compared 6 mg boron per day for 8 weeks with placebo, the supplements reduced symptoms of osteoarthritis in 20 participants younger than 75 years (mean age about 65 years) [ 33 ]. Another 8-week study in 20 patients with mild to moderate or severe osteoarthritis found that 6 mg/day boron as calcium fructoborate for mild to moderate osteoarthritis or 12 mg/day boron for severe disease reduced joint rigidity and the use of ibuprofen for pain and increased mobility and flexibility [ 31 ]. However, this study was very small and not blinded or placebo controlled.\nA subsequent double-blind, placebo-controlled trial examined the effects of 1.5, 3, or 6 mg/day boron (as calcium fructoborate) for 2 weeks on inflammatory biomarkers (e.g., C-reactive protein and fibrinogen) in 60 participants with osteoarthritis age 59–68 years [ 30 ]. Supplementation significantly reduced inflammatory markers. In another double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, supplementation with 6 mg/day boron (as calcium fructoborate) for 2 weeks significantly reduced knee discomfort in 60 adults (mean age 50 years) with self-reported knee discomfort [ 34 ].\nThese findings suggest that boron, particularly as calcium fructoborate, might hold promise for reducing osteoarthritis symptoms, but confirmation is needed from additional controlled trials.\n",
    "Bone health": "Boron might be important for bone growth and formation, possibly by affecting osteoblast and/or osteoclast activity or by influencing serum steroid hormone levels and calcium metabolism [ 4 , 6 , 11 , 32 ]. Animal studies indicate that boron deficiency causes abnormal limb development; delayed maturation of growth plates; and decreased bone strength, bone volume fraction, and trabecular thickness [ 6 , 35 ].\nComparisons of animals receiving boron supplementation with animals that consume usual or small amounts of boron show that the supplementation improves some measures of bone strength [ 36-38 ]. However, in an observational study in 134 Korean women (average age 41 years), boron intakes (mean of 0.9 mg/day) were not significantly correlated with bone mineral density in the lumbar spine or femoral regions [ 39 ].\nIn a placebo-controlled clinical trial of 17 female athletes (mean age 19.8 years) and 11 sedentary females (mean age 20.3 years), 3 mg/day boron supplementation for 10 months significantly reduced serum phosphorus levels and increased serum magnesium levels in sedentary females; such changes are often associated with increased bone mineral density [ 40 ]. However, supplementation in this study did not directly affect bone mineral density.\nAdditional research is needed to determine whether boron supplementation affects bone health in humans.\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Boron": "No data are available on adverse effects of high boron intakes from food or water [ 2 ].\nSymptoms associated with accidental consumption of boric acid or borax (sodium borate), contained in some household cleaning products and pesticides, include nausea, gastrointestinal discomfort, vomiting, diarrhea, skin flushing, rash, excitation, convulsions, depression, and vascular collapse [ 2 , 6 , 46 ]. The amount of boron consumed in people who accidentally consumed boron ranged from 18 to 9,713 mg, and most were children younger than 6 years [ 46 ]. Boron toxicity can also cause headache, hypothermia, restlessness, weariness, renal injury, dermatitis, alopecia, anorexia, and indigestion. In infants, high boron intakes have caused anemia, seizures, erythema, and thin hair [ 9 ]. Extremely high doses of boron can be fatal; for example, 15,000 to 20,000 mg can cause death in adults [ 6 , 9 ].\nThe FNB established boron ULs for healthy individuals based on levels associated with reproductive and developmental effects in animals [ 2 ].\n* Breast milk, formula, and food should be the only sources of boron for infants.\n",
    "Boron and Healthful Diets": "The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Many fruits are rich sources of boron. Potatoes, milk, and milk products also contain boron. Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. Peanuts and other legumes contain boron. Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Limits alcoholic beverages. Stays within your daily calorie needs.\nMany fruits are rich sources of boron. Potatoes, milk, and milk products also contain boron.\nPeanuts and other legumes contain boron.\n",

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet .\n",
    "Introduction": "Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in some foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement and a prescription medication. Because vitamin B12 contains the mineral cobalt, compounds with vitamin B12 activity are collectively called cobalamins [ 1 ]. Methylcobalamin and 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin are the metabolically active forms of vitamin B12. However, two others forms, hydroxycobalamin and cyanocobalamin, become biologically active after they are converted to methylcobalamin or 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin [ 1-3 ].\nVitamin B12 is required for the development, myelination, and function of the central nervous system; healthy red blood cell formation; and DNA synthesis [ 1 , 4 , 5 ]. Vitamin B12 functions as a cofactor for two enzymes, methionine synthase and L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase [ 1-3 , 5 ]. Methionine synthase catalyzes the conversion of homocysteine to the essential amino acid methionine [ 1 , 2 ]. Methionine is required for the formation of S-adenosylmethionine, a universal methyl donor for almost 100 different substrates, including DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids [ 3 , 5 ]. L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase converts L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA in the metabolism of propionate, a short-chain fatty acid [ 2 ].\nVitamin B12 is bound to protein in food and must be released before it is absorbed [ 5 ]. The process starts in the mouth when food is mixed with saliva. The freed vitamin B12 then binds with haptocorrin, a cobalamin-binding protein in the saliva. More vitamin B12 is released from its food matrix by the activity of hydrochloric acid and gastric protease in the stomach, where it then binds to haptocorrin [ 1 ]. In the duodenum, digestive enzymes free the vitamin B12 from haptocorrin, and this freed vitamin B12 combines with intrinsic factor, a transport and delivery binding protein secreted by the stomach’s parietal cells. The resulting complex is absorbed in the distal ileum by receptor-mediated endocytosis [ 1 , 5 ]. If vitamin B12 is added to fortified foods and dietary supplements, it is already in free form and therefore does not require the separation step.\nVitamin B12 status is typically assessed by measurements of serum or plasma vitamin B12 levels. The cutoff between normal vitamin B12 levels and deficiency varies by method and laboratory, but most laboratories define subnormal serum or plasma values as those lower than 200 or 250 pg/mL (148 or 185 pmol/L) [ 2 ]. Levels of serum methylmalonic acid (MMA), a vitamin B12-associated metabolite, are the most sensitive markers of vitamin B12 status, and an MMA level greater than 0.271 micromol/L suggests vitamin B12 deficiency [ 6-8 ]. However, MMA levels also rise with renal insufficiency and tend to be higher in older adults [ 6 , 9 , 10 ]. Another marker is total plasma homocysteine levels, which rise quickly as vitamin B12 status declines; a serum homocysteine level higher than 15 micromol/L, for example, suggests vitamin B12 deficiency [ 11 ]. However, this indicator has poor specificity because it is influenced by other factors, such as low folate levels and, especially, by declines in kidney function [ 6 ]. Experts suggest that if a patient’s serum vitamin B12 level is between 150 to 399 pg/mL (111 to 294 pmol/L), the patient’s serum MMA levels should be checked to help confirm a diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency [ 7 , 9 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for vitamin B12 and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [ 1 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nTable 1 lists the current RDAs for vitamin B12 [ 1 ]. For adults, the main criterion that the FNB used to establish the RDAs was the amount needed to maintain a healthy hematological status and serum vitamin B12 levels. For infants age 0 to 12 months, the FNB established an AI that is equivalent to the mean intake of vitamin B12 in healthy, breastfed infants.\n* Adequate Intake (AI)\n",
    "Food": "Vitamin B12 is present in foods of animal origin, including fish, meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy products [ 5 , 12 ].\nPlant foods do not naturally contain vitamin B12. However, fortified breakfast cereals and fortified nutritional yeasts are readily available sources of vitamin B12 that have high bioavailability [ 13 , 14 ].\nThe average vitamin B12 level in the breast milk of women with vitamin B12 intakes above the RDA is 0.44 mcg/L [ 15 ]. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specifies that infant formulas sold in the United States must provide at least 0.15 mcg vitamin B12 per 100 kcal [ 16 ].\nThe estimated bioavailability of vitamin B12 from food varies by vitamin B12 dose because absorption decreases drastically when the capacity of intrinsic factor is exceeded (at 1–2 mcg of vitamin B12) [ 17 ]. Bioavailability also varies by type of food source. For example, the bioavailability of vitamin B12 appears to be about three times higher in dairy products than in meat, fish, and poultry, and the bioavailability of vitamin B12 from dietary supplements is about 50% higher than that from food sources [ 18-20 ].\nA variety of foods and their vitamin B12 levels per serving are listed in Table 2.\n*DV = Daily Value. FDA developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for vitamin B12 is 2.4 mcg for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 22 ]. FDA does not require food labels to list vitamin B12 content unless vitamin B12 has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA's) FoodData Central [ 21 ] lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing vitamin B12 arranged by nutrient content and by food name.\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "Vitamin B12 is available in multivitamin/mineral supplements, in supplements containing other B-complex vitamins, and in supplements containing only vitamin B12. Multivitamin/mineral supplements typically contain vitamin B12 at doses ranging from 5 to 25 mcg [ 23 ]. Vitamin B12 levels are higher, generally 50–500 mcg, in supplements containing vitamin B12 with other B-complex vitamins and even higher, typically 500–1,000 mcg, in supplements containing only vitamin B12.\nThe most common form of vitamin B12 in dietary supplements is cyanocobalamin [ 1 , 3 , 23 , 24 ]. Other forms of vitamin B12 in supplements are adenosylcobalamin, methylcobalamin, and hydroxycobalamin [ 23 ].\nNo evidence indicates that absorption rates of vitamin B12 in supplements vary by form of the vitamin. These rates are about 50% at doses (less than 1–2 mcg) that do not exceed the cobalamin-binding capacity of intrinsic factor and are substantially lower at doses well above 1–2 mcg [ 24 , 25 ]. For example, absorption is only about 2% at doses of 500 mcg and 1.3% at doses of 1,000 mcg [ 25 ].\nIn addition to oral dietary supplements, vitamin B12 is available in sublingual preparations as tablets or lozenges [ 23 ]. Evidence suggests no difference in efficacy between oral and sublingual forms [ 26 , 27 ].\n",

    "Individuals with gastrointestinal disorders": "Individuals with stomach and small intestine disorders, such as celiac disease and Crohn’s disease, may be unable to absorb enough vitamin B12 from food to maintain healthy body stores [ 2 , 3 , 49 ]. However, although rates of vitamin B12 deficiency are higher in people with celiac disease than other people [ 50 ], the evidence for whether rates of vitamin B12 deficiency are higher in people with Crohn’s disease is mixed [ 49 , 51 , 52 ]. Vitamin B12 deficiency in people with Crohn’s disease is typically treated with intramuscular cobalamin injections, but high doses of oral cyanocobalamin therapy (e.g., 1,000 mcg/day) might be equally effective [ 53 ].\n",
    "Vitamin A and Health": NaN,
    "Cancer": "The evidence for a relationship between vitamin B12 and cancer risk is mixed. Some evidence supports a link between increased cancer risk and higher intakes or blood concentrations of vitamin B12, some supports a link with lower intakes or concentrations, and some evidence indicates no link at all.\nObservational evidence supporting an association between higher vitamin B12 levels and increased cancer risk includes an analysis of data on 757,185 people (median age 56 years) with plasma vitamin B12 measurements [ 60 ]. The results showed that the adjusted 1-year risk of cancer was 1.74 to 4.72 times higher among those with vitamin B12 levels above 813 pg/mL (600 pmol/L) than those with levels in the normal range of 203–813 pg/mL (150–600 pmol/L). An analysis by some of the same investigators of data from Danish medical registries for 25,017 people who had a cancer diagnosis between 1998 and 2014 found 1-year survival rates of 35.8% in those whose plasma cobalamin levels were higher than 1,084 pg/mL (800 pmol/L) and 69.3% in those with levels between 271 and 813 pg/mL (200–600 pmol/L) [ 61 ].\nSome observational evidence also shows an association between supplements containing vitamin B12 and a higher risk of certain types of cancer. For example, an assessment of 77,118 participants age 50 to 76 years in the Vitamins and Lifestyle cohort study found that use of at least 55 mcg/day supplemental vitamin B12 for an average of 10 years was associated with a 40% higher risk of lung cancer in men [ 62 ]. However, the study found no association between supplemental vitamin B12 use and cancer risk in women.\nLimited clinical trial evidence supports the finding that higher vitamin B12 intakes might increase cancer risk. In an analysis of data on 2,524 participants in the B Vitamins for the Prevention of Osteoporotic Fractures trial who were treated with supplements containing 400 mcg/day folic acid and 500 mcg/day vitamin B12 for 2 to 3 years, the risk of colorectal cancer was significantly higher, at 3.4%, in the supplementation group than in the placebo group, whose rate was 2% [ 63 ]. However, high folic acid levels are potentially linked to increased risk of colorectal cancer, so the result might be due to the folic acid rather than the vitamin B12 [ 64 ]. Furthermore, the supplements had no significant effect on overall cancer risk.\nSome observational evidence shows no association between high vitamin B12 concentrations or intakes and increased risk of certain cancers. For example, higher vitamin B12 intakes or serum concentrations were not associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer [ 65 ], breast cancer [ 66 ], or esophageal cancer or gastric cancer [ 67 ]. Clinical trials support the lack of association between higher vitamin B12 intakes and cancer risk. [ 68-70 ]. For example, a meta-analysis of 18 RCTs that included 74,498 individuals found that supplements containing B vitamins, including 20 to 2,000 mcg/day vitamin B12, had little or no effect on cancer incidence, cancer deaths, or all-cause mortality during follow-up periods of 2 to 7.3 years [ 70 ].\nFinally, evidence pointing to an association between lower vitamin B12 levels and a higher cancer risk includes observational data showing a risk of gastric cancer that was 5.8 times higher in male smokers with lower vitamin B12 levels (less than 394 pg/mL [291 pmol/L]) than in those with levels higher than 591 pg/mL (436 pmol/L) [ 71 ]. Also, two meta-analyses found associations between lower vitamin B12 concentrations or intakes and a higher risk of colorectal cancer [ 72 ] and prostate cancer [ 73 ].\nMore evidence is needed to clarify whether high or low intakes of vitamin B12 influence the risk of cancer as well as the role of vitamin B12 in preventing cancer.\n",

    "Prescription medications": "Vitamin B12, in the forms of cyanocobalamin and hydroxycobalamin, can be administered parenterally as a prescription medication, usually by intramuscular injection [ 2 ]. Parenteral administration is typically used to treat vitamin B12 deficiency caused by pernicious anemia as well as other conditions (e.g., tropical sprue, pancreatic insufficiency) that result in vitamin B12 malabsorption and severe vitamin B12 deficiency [ 5 ].\nVitamin B12 is also available as a prescription nasal gel spray. This formulation appears to be effective in raising vitamin B12 blood levels in adults and children [ 28 , 29 ]. A small clinical study with 10 participants (mean age 81 years) found that the bioavailability of a 1,000 mcg cobalamin dose was 2% with intranasal administration, which is similar to the bioavailability of an oral dose [ 30 ].\n",
    "Vitamin B12 Intakes and Status": "Most people in the United States consume adequate amounts of vitamin B12. Data from the 2017–March 2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) show that mean daily intakes of vitamin B12 from food and beverages were 5.84 mcg for men age 20 and older and 3.69 mcg for women [ 31 ]. For children and adolescents age 2 to 19, mean daily intakes of vitamin B12 ranged from 3.66 mcg to 4.52 mcg [ 31 ]. Only 5% of U.S. men and 11% of women had intakes from food and beverages below the vitamin B12 EAR of 2 mcg [ 32 ]. People of low socioeconomic status, women, and non-Hispanic Blacks are most likely to have low vitamin B12 intakes [ 33 ].\nApproximately 24% of men and 29% of women reported using a dietary supplement containing vitamin B12 in NHANES 2017–March 2020 [ 32 ]. The proportion in children and adolescents ranged from 28% of those age 2 to 5 years to 9% of those age 12 to 19. Mean daily vitamin B12 intakes among supplement users from food, beverages, and supplements were 297.3 mcg for men age 20 and older, 407.4 mcg for women, and from 24.7 to 47.4 mcg for children and adolescents.\nAccording to an analysis of NHANES data from 2007–2018, approximately 3.6% of all adults age 19 and older have vitamin B12 deficiency (assessed as serum vitamin B12 <200 pg/mL [148 pmol/L]), and the rate is 3.7% in those age 60 and older [ 34 ]. However, vitamin B12 insufficiency (assessed as serum vitamin B12 <300 pg/mL [221 pmol/L]) is more prevalent, affecting approximately 12.5% of all adults age 19 and older, and 12.3% of those age 60 and older [ 34 ]. During pregnancy, serum vitamin B12 levels tend to drop, sometimes to subnormal levels, but they usually return to normal after delivery [ 35 ].\n",
    "Vitamin B12 Deficiency": "Causes of vitamin B12 deficiency include difficulty absorbing vitamin B12 from food, lack of intrinsic factor (e.g., because of pernicious anemia), surgery in the gastrointestinal tract, prolonged use of certain medications (e.g., metformin or proton pump inhibitors, discussed in more detail below in the section on interactions with medications), and dietary deficiency [ 5 , 7 ]. Because people who have difficulty absorbing vitamin B12 from food absorb free vitamin B12 normally, their vitamin B12 deficiency tends to be less severe than that of individuals with pernicious anemia, who cannot absorb either food-bound or free vitamin B12. Certain congenital conditions, such as hereditary intrinsic factor defects and congenital vitamin B12 malabsorption (Imerslund-Gräsbeck disease), can also cause severe vitamin B12 deficiency [ 5 ].\nThe effects of vitamin B12 deficiency can include the hallmark megaloblastic anemia (characterized by large, abnormally nucleated red blood cells) as well as low counts of white and red blood cells, platelets, or a combination; glossitis of the tongue; fatigue; palpitations; pale skin; dementia; weight loss; and infertility [ 2 , 5 , 7 ]. Neurological changes, such as numbness and tingling in the hands and feet, can also occur [ 7 ]. These neurological symptoms can occur without anemia, so early diagnosis and intervention is important to avoid irreversible damage [ 36 ]. In addition, some studies have found associations between vitamin B12 deficiency or low vitamin B12 intakes and depression [ 37-39 ]. In pregnant and breastfeeding women, vitamin B12 deficiency might cause neural tube defects, developmental delays, failure to thrive, and anemia in offspring [ 7 ].\nBecause the body stores about 1 to 5 mg vitamin B12 (or about 1,000 to 2,000 times as much as the amount typically consumed in a day), the symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency can take several years to appear [ 7 , 40 ].\nVitamin B12 deficiency with the classic hematologic and neurologic signs and symptoms is uncommon [ 11 ]. However, low or marginal vitamin B12 status (200–300 pg/mL [148–221 pmol/L]) without these symptoms is much more common, at up to 40% in Western populations, especially in those with low intakes of vitamin B12-rich foods [ 9 , 11 ]. The prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency varies by cutoff level and biomarker used. For example, among adults age 19 and older who participated in NHANES between 1999 and 2004, the rate of low vitamin B12 levels in serum was 3% with a cutoff of less than 200 pg/mL (148 pmol/L) and 26% with a cutoff of less than 350 pg/mL (258 pmol/L) [ 39 ]. Approximately 21% of adults older than 60 had abnormal levels of at least one vitamin B12 biomarker [ 41 ].\nTypically, vitamin B12 deficiency is treated with vitamin B12 injections because this method bypasses any barriers to absorption. However, high doses of oral vitamin B12 might also be effective. A 2018 Cochrane Review included three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared very high doses (1,000–2,000 mcg) of oral with intramuscular vitamin B12 for vitamin B12 deficiency in a total of 153 participants [ 42 ]. The evidence from these studies, although of low quality, showed that the ability of high oral doses of vitamin B12 supplements to normalize serum vitamin B12 was similar to that of intramuscular vitamin B12.\n",
    "Groups at Risk of Vitamin B12 Inadequacy": "The following groups are among those most likely to be vitamin B12 deficient.\n",
    "Older adults": "Depending on the definition used, between 3% and 43% of community-dwelling older adults, especially those with atrophic gastritis, have vitamin B12 deficiency based on serum vitamin B12 levels [ 43 , 44 ]. The deficiency rate at a cutoff of less than 211 pg/mL (156 pmol/L) at admission to a long-term care facility, according to one study, was 14%, and 38% of these older adults had levels lower than 407 pg/mL (300 pmol/L) [ 44 ].\nConditions associated with vitamin B12 inadequacy include pernicious anemia, present in about 15% to 25% of older adults with vitamin B12 deficiency [ 45 ]. Atrophic gastritis, an autoimmune condition affecting 2% of the general population but 8%–9% of adults age 65 and older, decreases production of intrinsic factor and secretion of hydrochloric acid in the stomach and thus decreases absorption of vitamin B12 [ 45 , 46 ]. A third condition associated with vitamin B12 deficiency in older adults is Helicobacter pylori infection, possibly because this bacterium causes inflammation that leads to malabsorption of vitamin B12 from food [ 47 ].\n",
    "Individuals with pernicious anemia": "Pernicious anemia is an irreversible autoimmune disease that affects the gastric mucosa and results in gastric atrophy [ 1 , 48 ]. This disease leads to attacks on parietal cells in the stomach, resulting in failure to produce intrinsic factor and malabsorption of dietary vitamin B12, recycled biliary vitamin B12, and free vitamin B12 [ 1 , 6 , 11 ].Therefore, without treatment, pernicious anemia causes vitamin B12 deficiency, even in the presence of adequate vitamin B12 intakes.\nPernicious anemia is the most common cause of clinically evident vitamin B12 deficiency around the world [ 11 , 48 ]. The incidence of pernicious anemia in the United States is an estimated 151 per 100,000, and this condition is more common in women and in people of European ancestry [ 48 ].\n",
    "Individuals who have had gastrointestinal surgery": "Surgical procedures in the gastrointestinal tract, such as for weight loss or to remove all or part of the stomach, can cause a complete or partial loss of cells that secrete hydrochloric acid and cells that secrete intrinsic factor [ 54 , 55 ]. Thus, these procedures reduce the amount of vitamin B12, particularly food-bound vitamin B12, that the body absorbs [ 54 , 55 ]. High doses (1,000 mcg/day) of oral methylcobalamin supplements appear to be as effective as hydroxycobalamin injections in normalizing vitamin B12 values in patients who have undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery [ 55 ].\n",
    "Vegetarians": "Vegans who consume no animal products and vegetarians who consume some animal products (e.g., dairy products, eggs, or both) but not meat have a higher risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency because natural food sources of vitamin B12 are limited to animal foods [ 3 , 57 ]. Consumption of foods fortified with vitamin B12 (such as fortified nutritional yeasts) as well as vitamin B12 supplements can substantially reduce the risk of deficiency [ 57 ].\n",
    "Infants of vegan women": "Exclusively breastfed infants of women who consume no animal products might have very limited reserves of vitamin B12 and can develop vitamin B12 deficiency, sometimes very early in life [ 58 ]. The infant’s deficiency can be severe, especially if the mother’s deficiency is severe or caused by pernicious anemia; sometimes, the mother’s own deficiency is clinically mild and not recognized. Undetected and untreated vitamin B12 deficiency in infants can result in neurological damage, failure to thrive, developmental delays, and anemia [ 2 , 58 , 59 ]. The reasons include the small amounts of vitamin B12 in the breast milk of vegan mothers as well as the limited amounts of vitamin B12 crossing the placenta in these women during fetal development.\n",
    "Vitamin B12 and Health": "This section focuses on areas of health in which vitamin B12 might be involved: cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke, dementia and cognitive function, and energy and endurance.\n",
    "Cardiovascular disease and stroke": "An elevated homocysteine level has been associated with an increased risk of CVD [ 74 , 75 ]. Vitamin B12 and other B vitamins are involved in homocysteine metabolism, and researchers have hypothesized that supplementation with these micronutrients can reduce CVD risk by lowering homocysteine levels [ 74 , 75 ].\nHowever, studies on the association between vitamin B12 intake and risk of CVD have had negative results. Two meta-analyses—one of 11 prospective cohort studies in 369,746 individuals who developed 5,133 cases of coronary heart disease and one of 12 prospective (mostly cohort) studies in 389,938 participants who developed 10,749 cases of stroke over 4.2 to 19 years (including 10 reports that evaluated the association between dietary vitamin B12 intake and stroke risk)—found no significant association between vitamin B12 intakes and risk of coronary heart disease [ 76 ] or stroke [ 77 ].\nRCTs have found that vitamin B12 (and folic acid) supplements lower homocysteine levels but not CVD risk. The authors of a Cochrane Review of the effects of homocysteine-lowering interventions on cardiovascular events based on 15 studies in 71,422 participants concluded that supplements of vitamin B12 alone or with other B vitamins do not prevent heart attacks or reduce death rates in people at risk of or with CVD [ 78 ]. More recently, an extended follow-up of the B-PROOF trial, (which compared 400 mcg folic acid and 500 mcg vitamin B-12 daily with placebo) in 1,298 participants found that after a median of 54 months, the intervention had no effect on CVD risk [ 79 ].\nOverall, the available evidence suggests that supplementation with vitamin B12 alone or in combination with other B-vitamins does not reduce the risk of CVD or of CVD-related death.\n",
    "Dementia and cognitive function": "Observational studies have shown positive associations between elevated homocysteine levels and the incidence of both Alzheimer’s disease and dementia [ 80-83 ]. Scientists hypothesize that elevated homocysteine levels might have a negative effect on the brain via numerous mechanisms, including cerebrovascular ischemia leading to neuronal cell death, activation of tau kinases leading to tangle deposition, and inhibition of methylation reactions [ 82 ].\nMost observational studies have found correlations between low serum vitamin B12 concentrations alone or in combination with high folate concentrations and poor cognitive function [ 84-89 ]. For example, an analysis of cross-sectional 2011–2014 NHANES data on 2,420 adults age 60 years or older found that low vitamin B12 (MMA greater than 0.27 micromol/L or serum vitamin B12 less than 203 pg/mL [150 pmol/L]) combined with high folic acid—unmetabolized serum folic acid greater than 0.44 mcg/L (1 nmol/L) or serum total folate higher than 32.7 mcg/L (74.1 nmol/L)—was associated with an almost two to three times higher risk of cognitive impairment [ 84 ].\nHowever, a few observational studies have found no such association [ 90 , 91 ]. In addition, according to a systematic review of 35 prospective cohort studies in 14,325 participants age 47 to 101 years followed for an average of 5.4 years, the evidence does not support a role for low vitamin B12 in the development of cognitive impairment or dementia [ 92 ].\nIn general, evidence from RCTs does not show that vitamin B12 supplementation alone or with folic acid, vitamin B6, or both for 1 to 2 years improves cognitive function in older adults with or without dementia, mild cognitive impairment, or Alzheimer’s disease, even though supplementation lowers homocysteine levels [ 93-96 ]. For example, an RCT administered 400 mcg/day folic acid and 500 mcg/day vitamin B12 (B-vitamin group) or a placebo for 2 years to 2,919 adults age 65 and older with homocysteine levels of 12 to 50 mcmol/L [ 95 ]. Although homocysteine concentrations declined significantly more (by 5.0 mcmol/L) in the supplementation group than in the placebo group (1.3 mcmol/L), cognitive test scores did not differ between groups. A Cochrane Review of vitamin and mineral supplements to maintain cognitive function in cognitively healthy people included 14 studies that compared folic acid, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, or a combination of these supplements to placebo in 27,882 participants, most of whom were age 60 years or older [ 97 ]. The supplements had little to no effect on global cognitive function when administered for up to 5 years and appeared to have no impact when administered for 5 to 10 years.\nSimilarly, supplementation with vitamin B12 alone or with other B vitamins does not appear to decrease the risk or slow the progression of dementia or Alzheimer’s disease in older adults. A Cochrane Review evaluated the effects of vitamin and mineral supplements on cognitive function and dementia in people with mild cognitive impairment [ 98 ]. The review included five trials with 879 participants that investigated B vitamin supplements (one study of folic acid only and four trials of vitamins B6 and B12 and folic acid). Taking these B vitamins for 6 to 24 months had no apparent effect on episodic memory, executive function, speed of processing, or quality of life, although one study found a slower rate of brain atrophy over 2 years.\nAdditional clinical trials are needed to better understand the effects of vitamin B12 supplementation on cognitive function and cognitive decline.\n",
    "Energy and endurance": "Because of its role in energy metabolism, vitamin B12 is often promoted as an energy enhancer and an athletic performance and endurance booster. However, vitamin B12 supplementation appears to have no beneficial effect on performance in the absence of a nutritional deficit [ 99 , 100 ].\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Vitamin B12": "The FNB did not establish a UL for vitamin B12 because of its low potential for toxicity [ 1 ]. Even at large doses, vitamin B12 is generally considered to be safe because the body does not store excess amounts.\n",
    "Gastric acid inhibitors": "Gastric acid inhibitors include proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole (Prilosec) and lansoprazole (Prevacid), and histamine 2-receptor antagonists, such as cimetidine (Tagamet) and ranitidine (Zantac). These drugs are used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease and peptic ulcer disease. They can interfere with vitamin B12 absorption from food by slowing the release of gastric acid into the stomach and thereby lead to vitamin B12 deficiency [ 101-103 ].\n",
    "Metformin": "Metformin, an antihyperglycemic agent used as first-line treatment for prediabetes and diabetes, might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 and significantly reduce serum vitamin B12 concentrations [ 103 ].\n",
    "Vitamin B12 and Healthful Diets": "The federal government’s 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Milk and milk products are good sources of vitamin B12. Many ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are fortified with vitamin B12. Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. Fish and red meat are excellent sources of vitamin B12. Poultry and eggs also contain vitamin B12. Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Limits alcoholic beverages. Stays within your daily calorie needs.\nMilk and milk products are good sources of vitamin B12. Many ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are fortified with vitamin B12.\nFish and red meat are excellent sources of vitamin B12. Poultry and eggs also contain vitamin B12.\n",

    "Introduction": "Vitamin B6 is a water-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in many foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. It is the generic name for six compounds (vitamers) with vitamin B6 activity: pyridoxine, an alcohol; pyridoxal, an aldehyde; and pyridoxamine, which contains an amino group; and their respective 5'-phosphate esters. Pyridoxal 5' phosphate (PLP) and pyridoxamine 5' phosphate (PMP) are the active coenzyme forms of vitamin B6 [ 1 , 2 ]. Substantial proportions of the naturally occurring pyridoxine in fruits, vegetables, and grains exist in glycosylated forms that exhibit reduced bioavailability [ 3 ].\nVitamin B6 in coenzyme forms performs a wide variety of functions in the body and is extremely versatile, with involvement in more than 100 enzyme reactions, mostly concerned with protein metabolism [ 1 ]. Both PLP and PMP are involved in amino acid metabolism, and PLP is also involved in the metabolism of one-carbon units, carbohydrates, and lipids [ 3 ]. Vitamin B6 also plays a role in cognitive development through the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters and in maintaining normal levels of homocysteine, an amino acid in the blood [ 3 ]. Vitamin B6 is involved in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, immune function (for example, it promotes lymphocyte and interleukin-2 production), and hemoglobin formation [ 3 ].\nThe human body absorbs vitamin B6 in the jejunum. Phosphorylated forms of the vitamin are dephosphorylated, and the pool of free vitamin B6 is absorbed by passive diffusion [ 2 ].\nVitamin B6 concentrations can be measured directly by assessing concentrations of PLP; other vitamers; or total vitamin B6 in plasma, erythrocytes, or urine [ 1 ]. Vitamin B6 concentrations can also be measured indirectly by assessing either erythrocyte aminotransferase saturation by PLP or tryptophan metabolites. Plasma PLP is the most common measure of vitamin B6 status.\nPLP concentrations of more than 30 nmol/L have been traditional indicators of adequate vitamin B6 status in adults [ 3 ]. However, the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies (formerly National Academy of Sciences) used a plasma PLP level of 20 nmol/L as the major indicator of adequacy to calculate the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for adults [ 1 , 3 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for vitamin B6 and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the FNB [ 1 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and gender, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects.\nTable 1 lists the current RDAs for vitamin B6 [ 1 ]. For infants from birth to 12 months, the FNB established an AI for vitamin B6 that is equivalent to the mean intake of vitamin B6 in healthy, breastfed infants.\n* Adequate Intake (AI)\n",
    "Food": "Vitamin B6 is found in a wide variety of foods [ 1 , 3 , 4 ]. The richest sources of vitamin B6 include fish, beef liver and other organ meats, potatoes and other starchy vegetables, and fruit (other than citrus). In the United States, adults obtain most of their dietary vitamin B6 from fortified cereals, beef, poultry, starchy vegetables, and some noncitrus fruits [ 1 , 3 , 5 ]. About 75% of vitamin B6 from a mixed diet is bioavailable [ 1 ].\nThe table of selected food sources of vitamin B6 suggests many dietary sources of vitamin B6.\n*DV = Daily Value. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for vitamin B6 is 1.7 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 6 ]. FDA does not require food labels to list vitamin B6 content unless vitamin B6 has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) FoodData Central lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing vitamin B6 arranged by nutrient content and by food name .\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "Vitamin B6 is available in multivitamins, in supplements containing other B complex vitamins, and as a stand-alone supplement [ 7 ]. The most common vitamin B6 vitamer in supplements is pyridoxine (in the form of pyridoxine hydrochloride [HCl]), although some supplements contain PLP. Vitamin B6 supplements are available in oral capsules or tablets (including sublingual and chewable tablets) and liquids. Absorption of vitamin B6 from supplements is similar to that from food sources and does not differ substantially among the various forms of supplements [ 1 ]. Although the body absorbs large pharmacological doses of vitamin B6 well, it quickly eliminates most of the vitamin in the urine [ 8 ].\nAbout 28%–36% of the general population uses supplements containing vitamin B6 [ 9 , 10 ]. Adults age 51 years or older and children younger than 9 are more likely than members of other age groups to take supplements containing vitamin B6.\n",

For example, an analysis of data from two large randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in Norway found no association between vitamin B6 supplementation and cancer incidence, mortality, or all-cause mortality [ 18 ].\n",

    "Vitamin B6 Intakes and Status": "Most children, adolescents, and adults in the United States consume the recommended amounts of vitamin B6, according to an analysis of data from the 2003–2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) [ 10 ]. The average vitamin B6 intake is about 1.5 mg/day in women and 2 mg/day in men [ 1 ].\nHowever, 11% of vitamin B6 supplement users and 24% of people in the United States who do not take supplements containing vitamin B6 have low plasma PLP concentrations (less than 20 nmol/L) [ 10 ]. In the 2003–2004 NHANES analysis, plasma PLP concentrations were low even in some groups that took 2.0–2.9 mg/day, which is higher than the current RDA. Among supplement users and nonusers, plasma PLP levels were much lower in women than men, non-Hispanic blacks than non-Hispanic whites, current smokers than never smokers, and people who were underweight than those of normal weight. Teenagers had the lowest vitamin B6 concentrations, followed by adults age 21–44 years. However, plasma PLP levels in the elderly were not particularly low, even in those who did not use supplements. Based on these data, the authors of this analysis concluded that the current RDAs might not guarantee adequate vitamin B6 status in many population groups [ 10 ].\nPLP concentrations tend to be low in people with alcohol dependence; those with obesity; and pregnant women, especially those with preeclampsia or eclampsia [ 1 ]. They are also low in people with malabsorption syndromes such as celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis [ 3 ].\n",
    "Vitamin B6 Deficiency": "Isolated vitamin B6 deficiency is uncommon; inadequate vitamin B6 status is usually associated with low concentrations of other B-complex vitamins, such as vitamin B12 and folic acid [ 2 ]. Vitamin B6 deficiency causes biochemical changes that become more obvious as the deficiency progresses [ 2 ].\nVitamin B6 deficiency is associated with microcytic anemia, electroencephalographic abnormalities, dermatitis with cheilosis (scaling on the lips and cracks at the corners of the mouth) and glossitis (swollen tongue), depression and confusion, and weakened immune function [ 1 , 2 ]. Individuals with borderline vitamin B6 concentrations or mild deficiency might have no deficiency signs or symptoms for months or even years. In infants, vitamin B6 deficiency causes irritability, abnormally acute hearing, and convulsive seizures [ 2 ].\nEnd-stage renal diseases, chronic renal insufficiency, and other kidney diseases can cause vitamin B6 deficiency [ 3 ]. In addition, vitamin B6 deficiency can result from malabsorption syndromes, such as celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Certain genetic diseases, such as homocystinuria, can also cause vitamin B6 deficiency [ 2 ]. Some medications, such as antiepileptic drugs, can lead to deficiency over time.\n",
    "Groups at Risk of Vitamin B6 Inadequacy": "Frank vitamin B6 deficiencies are relatively rare in the United States but some individuals might have marginal vitamin B6 status [ 2 ]. The following groups are among those most likely to have inadequate intakes of vitamin B6.\n",
    "Individuals with impaired renal function": "People with poor renal function, including those with end-stage renal disease and chronic renal insufficiency, often have low vitamin B6 concentrations [ 3 ]. Plasma PLP concentrations are also low in patients receiving maintenance kidney dialysis or intermittent peritoneal dialysis, as well as those who have undergone a kidney transplant, perhaps due to increased metabolic clearance of PLP [ 11 ]. Patients with kidney disease often show clinical symptoms similar to those of people with vitamin B6 deficiency [ 11 ].\n",
    "Individuals with autoimmune disorders": "People with rheumatoid arthritis often have low vitamin B6 concentrations, and vitamin B6 concentrations tend to decrease with increased disease severity [ 3 ]. These low vitamin B6 levels are due to the inflammation caused by the disease and, in turn, increase the inflammation associated with the disease. Although vitamin B6 supplements can normalize vitamin B6 concentrations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, they do not suppress the production of inflammatory cytokines or decrease levels of inflammatory markers [ 3 , 12 ].\nPatients with celiac disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and other malabsorptive autoimmune disorders tend to have low plasma PLP concentrations [ 3 ]. The mechanisms for this effect are not known. However, celiac disease is associated with lower pyridoxine absorption, and low PLP concentrations in inflammatory bowel disease could be due to the inflammatory response [ 3 ].\n",
    "People with alcohol dependence": "Plasma PLP concentrations tend to be very low in people with alcohol dependence [ 1 ]. Alcohol produces acetaldehyde, which decreases net PLP formation by cells and competes with PLP in protein binding [ 1 , 3 ]. As a result, the PLP in cells might be more susceptible to hydrolysis by membrane-bound phosphatase. People with alcohol dependence might benefit from pyridoxine supplementation [ 3 ].\n",
    "Cardiovascular disease": "Scientists have hypothesized that certain B vitamins (folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6) might reduce cardiovascular disease risk by lowering homocysteine levels [ 1 , 13 ]. Therefore, several clinical trials have assessed the safety and efficacy of supplemental doses of B vitamins to reduce heart disease risk. Evaluating the impact of vitamin B6 from many of these trials is challenging because these studies also included folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation. For example, the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation 2 (HOPE 2) trial, which included more than 5,500 adults with known cardiovascular disease, found that supplementation for 5 years with vitamin B6 (50 mg/day), vitamin B12 (1 mg/day), and folic acid (2.5 mg/day) reduced homocysteine levels and decreased stroke risk by about 25%, but the study did not include a separate vitamin B6 group [ 14 ].\nMoreover, most other large clinical trials have failed to demonstrate that supplemental B vitamins actually reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, even though they lower homocysteine levels. For example, a randomized clinical trial in 5,442 women age 42 or older found no effect of vitamin B6 supplementation (50 mg/day) in combination with 2.5 mg folic acid and 1 mg vitamin B12 on cardiovascular disease risk [ 15 ]. Two large randomized controlled trials, the Norwegian Vitamin Trial and the Western Norway B Vitamin Intervention Trial, did include a group that received only vitamin B6 supplements (40 mg/day). The combined analysis of data from these two trials showed no benefit of vitamin B6 supplementation, with or without folic acid (0.8 mg/day) plus vitamin B12 (0.4 mg/day), on major cardiovascular events in 6,837 patients with ischemic heart disease [ 13 ]. In a trial of adults who had suffered a nondisabling stroke, supplementation with high or low doses of a combination of vitamins B6 and B12 and folic acid for 2 years had no effect on subsequent stroke incidence, cardiovascular events, or risk of death [ 16 ].\nThe research to date provides little evidence that supplemental amounts of vitamin B6, alone or with folic acid and vitamin B12, can help reduce the risk or severity of cardiovascular disease and stroke.\n",
    "Cognitive function": "Poor vitamin B6 status has been hypothesized to play a role in the cognitive decline that some older adults experience [ 19 ]. Several studies have demonstrated an association between vitamin B6 and brain function in the elderly. For example, an analysis of data from the Boston Normative Aging Study found associations between higher serum vitamin B6 concentrations and better memory test scores in 70 men age 54–81 years [ 20 ].\nHowever, a systematic review of 14 randomized controlled trials found insufficient evidence of an effect of vitamin B6 supplementation alone or in combination with vitamin B12 and/or folic acid on cognitive function in people with normal cognitive function, dementia, or ischemic vascular disease [ 19 ]. According to this review, most of the studies were of low quality and limited applicability. A Cochrane Review found no evidence that short-term vitamin B6 supplementation (for 5–12 weeks) improves cognitive function or mood in the two studies that the authors evaluated [ 21 ]. The review did find some evidence that daily vitamin B6 supplements (20 mg) can affect biochemical indices of vitamin B6 status in healthy older men, but these changes had no overall impact on cognition.\nMore evidence is needed to determine whether vitamin B6 supplements might help prevent or treat cognitive decline in elderly people.\n",
    "Premenstrual syndrome": "Some evidence suggests that vitamin B6 supplements could reduce the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), but conclusions are limited due to the poor quality of most studies [ 22 ]. A meta-analysis of nine published trials involving almost 1,000 women with PMS found that vitamin B6 is more effective in reducing PMS symptoms than placebo, but most of the studies analyzed were small and several had methodological weaknesses [ 22 ]. A more recent double-blind, randomized controlled trial in 94 women found that 80 mg pyridoxine taken daily over the course of three cycles was associated with statistically significant reductions in a broad range of PMS symptoms, including moodiness; irritability; forgetfulness; bloating; and, especially, anxiety [ 23 ]. The potential effectiveness of vitamin B6 in alleviating the mood-related symptoms of PMS could be due to its role as a cofactor in neurotransmitter biosynthesis [ 24 ]. Although vitamin B6 shows promise for alleviating PMS symptoms, more research is needed before drawing firm conclusions.\n",
    "Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy": "About half of all women experience nausea and vomiting in the first few months of pregnancy, and about 50%–80% experience nausea only [ 25 , 26 ]. Although this condition is generally known as morning sickness, it often lasts throughout the day. The condition is not life threatening and typically goes away after 12–20 weeks, but its symptoms can disrupt a person's social and physical functioning.\nProspective studies on vitamin B6 supplements to treat morning sickness have had mixed results. In two randomized, placebo-controlled trials, 30–75 mg of oral pyridoxine per day significantly decreased nausea in pregnant women who were experiencing nausea [ 27 , 28 ]. The authors of a recent Cochrane Review of studies on interventions for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy could not draw firm conclusions on the value of vitamin B6 to control the symptoms of morning sickness [ 26 ].\nRandomized trials have shown that a combination of vitamin B6 and doxylamine (an antihistamine) is associated with a 70% reduction in nausea and vomiting in pregnant women and lower hospitalization rates for this problem [ 25 , 29 ].\nThe American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) recommends monotherapy with 10–25 mg of vitamin B6 three or four times a day to treat nausea and vomiting in pregnancy [ 29 ]. If the patient's condition does not improve, ACOG recommends adding doxylamine. Before taking a vitamin B6 supplement, pregnant women should consult a physician because doses could approach the UL.\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Vitamin B6": "High intakes of vitamin B6 from food sources have not been reported to cause adverse effects [ 1 ]. However, chronic administration of 1–6 g oral pyridoxine per day for 12–40 months can cause severe and progressive sensory neuropathy characterized by ataxia (loss of control of bodily movements) [ 10 , 30-33 ]. Symptom severity appears to be dose dependent, and the symptoms usually stop if the patient discontinues the pyridoxine supplements as soon as the neurologic symptoms appear. Other effects of excessive vitamin B6 intakes include painful, disfiguring dermatological lesions; photosensitivity; and gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea and heartburn [ 1 , 2 , 30 ].\nThe scientific literature includes isolated case reports of congenital defects in the infants of women who took pyridoxine supplements during the first half of pregnancy [ 7 ]. However, a more recent observational study found no association between pyridoxine supplementation (mean dose 132.3 ± 74 mg/day) in pregnant women starting at 7 weeks gestation and continuing for 9 ± 4.2 weeks and teratogenic effects in their infants [ 34 ].\nThe FNB has established ULs for vitamin B6 that apply to both food and supplement intakes (Table 3) [ 1 ]. The FNB noted that although several reports show sensory neuropathy occurring at doses lower than 500 mg/day, studies in patients treated with vitamin B6 (average dose of 200 mg/day) for up to 5 years found no evidence of this effect. Based on limitations in the data on potential harms from long-term use, the FNB halved the dose used in these studies to establish a UL of 100 mg/day for adults. ULs are lower for children and adolescents based on body size. The ULs do not apply to individuals receiving vitamin B6 for medical treatment, but such individuals should be under the care of a physician.\n*Breast milk, formula, and food should be the only sources of vitamin B6 for infants.\nIn 2023, the Panel on Nutrition, Novel Foods and Food Allergens of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) released a scientific opinion on the tolerable upper intake levels for vitamin B6 [ 35 ]. Based on systematic reviews that examined associations between vitamin B6 and peripheral neuropathy, the panel set an upper limit for vitamin B6 of 12 mg/day for all adults, including women who are pregnant or lactating, with lower amounts ranging from 2.2 to 10.7 mg/day for infants and children, depending on age.\n",
    "Cycloserine": "Cycloserine (Seromycin) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis. In combination with pyridoxal phosphate, cycloserine increases urinary excretion of pyridoxine [ 9 ]. The urinary loss of pyridoxine might exacerbate the seizures and neurotoxicity associated with cycloserine. Pyridoxine supplements can help prevent these adverse effects.\n",
    "Antiepileptic medications": "Some antiepileptic drugs, including valproic acid (Depakene, Stavzor), carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Epitol, Tegretol, and others), and phenytoin (Dilantin) increase the catabolism rate of vitamin B6 vitamers, resulting in low plasma PLP concentrations and hyperhomocysteinemia [ 36 , 37 ]. High homocysteine levels in antiepileptic drug users might increase the risk of epileptic seizures and systemic vascular events, including stroke, and reduce the ability to control seizures in patients with epilepsy. Furthermore, patients typically use antiepileptic drugs for years, increasing their risk of chronic vascular toxicity.\nSome research also indicates that pyridoxine supplementation (200 mg/day for 12–120 days) can reduce serum concentrations of phenytoin and phenobarbital, possibly by increasing the drugs' metabolism [ 33 , 38 ]. Whether lower pyridoxine doses have any effect is not known [ 9 ].\nLevetiracetam (Keppra) is an antiepileptic medication with behavioral side effects that include irritability, agitation, and depression [ 39-41 ]. Preliminary evidence suggests that vitamin B6 supplementation—at such doses as 50–350 mg/day in children [ 40-42 ] and 50–100 mg/day in adults [ 39 ]—might reduce these side effects.\n",
    "Theophylline": "Theophylline (Aquaphyllin, Elixophyllin, Theolair, Truxophyllin, and many others) can prevent or treat shortness of breath, wheezing, and other breathing problems caused by asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and other lung diseases. Patients treated with theophylline often have low plasma PLP concentrations, which could contribute to the neurological and central nervous system side effects associated with theophylline, including seizures [ 9 , 33 ].\n",
    "Vitamin B6 and Healthful Diets": "The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Many fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are good sources of vitamin B6. Some ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are fortified with vitamin B6. Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. Fish, beef, and turkey contain high amounts of vitamin B6. Beans and nuts are also sources of vitamin B6. Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Limits alcoholic beverages. Stays within your daily calorie needs.\nMany fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are good sources of vitamin B6.

    "Table of Contents": "Introduction Recommended Intakes Sources of Calcium Calcium Intakes and Status Calcium Deficiency Groups at Risk of Calcium Inadequacy Calcium and Health Health Risks from Excessive Calcium Interactions with Medications Calcium and Healthful Diets References Disclaimer\nThis is a fact sheet intended for health professionals.  For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet .\n",
    "Introduction": "Calcium, the most abundant mineral in the body, is found in some foods, added to others, present in some medicines (such as antacids), and available as a dietary supplement.\nCalcium makes up much of the structure of bones and teeth and allows normal bodily movement by keeping tissue rigid, strong, and flexible [ 1 ]. The small ionized pool of calcium in the circulatory system, extracellular fluid, and various tissues mediates blood vessel contraction and dilation, muscle function, blood clotting, nerve transmission, and hormonal secretion [ 1 , 2 ].\nCalcium from foods and dietary supplements is absorbed by both active transport and by passive diffusion across the intestinal mucosa [ 1 , 3 ]. Active transport is responsible for most absorption when calcium intakes are lower, and passive diffusion accounts for an increasing proportion of calcium absorption as intakes rise. Vitamin D is required for calcium to be absorbed in the gut by active transport and to maintain adequate calcium levels in blood [ 1 ].\nAlmost all (98%) calcium in the body is stored in the bones, and the body uses the bones as a reservoir for, and source of, calcium to maintain calcium homeostasis [ 1 ]. More than 99% of calcium in the body is in the form of calcium hydroxyapatite, an inorganic matrix of calcium and phosphate that is stored in the bones and teeth [ 1 , 4 , 5 ]. Unlike teeth, bone undergoes continuous remodeling, with constant resorption and deposition of calcium into new bone [ 4 ]. Bone remodeling is required to change bone size during growth, repair damage, maintain serum calcium levels, and provide a source of other minerals [ 4 ].\nAt birth, the body contains about 26 to 30 g calcium. This amount rises quickly after birth, reaching about 1,200 g in women and 1,400 g in men by adulthood [ 1 ]. These levels remain constant in men, but they start to drop in women as a result of increases in bone remodeling due to decreased estrogen production at the start of menopause [ 1 ].\nAn inverse relationship exists between calcium intake and absorption. Absorption of calcium from food is about 45% at intakes of 200 mg/day but only 15% when intakes are higher than 2,000 mg/day [ 6 ]. Age can also affect absorption of dietary calcium [ 1 , 4 ]. Net absorption of dietary calcium is as high as 60% in infants and young children, who need substantial amounts to build bone, but it decreases to about 25% in adulthood and continues to decline with age [ 1 ].\nTotal calcium levels can be measured in serum or plasma; serum levels are typically 8.8 to 10.4 mg/dL (2.2 to 2.6 mmol/L) in healthy people [ 1 , 7 ]. However, serum levels do not reflect nutritional status because of their tight homeostatic control [ 4 ]. Levels of ionized (or free) calcium, the biologically active form, in serum are also used to measure calcium status. The normal range of ionized calcium in healthy people is 4.6 to 5.3 mg/dL (1.15 to 1.33 mmol/L) [ 7 ]. Dual x-ray absorptiometry testing of bone mineral density can be used to assess cumulative calcium status over the lifetime because the skeleton stores almost all calcium in the body [ 3 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for calcium and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [ 1 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nTable 1 lists the current RDAs for calcium [ 1 ]. For adults, the main criterion that the FNB used to establish the RDAs was the amount needed to promote bone maintenance and neutral calcium balance. For infants age 0 to 12 months, the FNB established an AI that is equivalent to the mean intake of calcium in healthy, breastfed infants. For children and adolescents, the RDAs are based on intakes associated with bone accumulation and positive calcium balance.\n*Adequate Intake (AI)\n",
    "Food": "Milk, yogurt, and cheese are rich natural sources of calcium [ 1 ]. In the United States, approximately 72% of calcium intakes come from dairy products and foods with added dairy ingredients [ 1 ]. Nondairy sources include canned sardines and salmon with bones as well as certain vegetables, such as kale, broccoli, and Chinese cabbage (bok choi). Most grains do not have high amounts of calcium unless they are fortified. However, they contribute to calcium intakes, even though they contain small amounts of calcium, because people consume them frequently [ 1 ]. Foods fortified with calcium in the United States include many fruit juices and drinks, tofu, and ready-to-eat cereals [ 1 , 8 ]. Calcium citrate malate is a well-absorbed form of calcium used in some fortified juices [ 3 ].\nCalcium absorption varies by type of food. The absorption of calcium from dairy products and fortified foods is about 30% [ 1 ]. Certain compounds in plants (e.g., oxalic acid, phytic acid) can decrease calcium absorption by forming indigestible salts with calcium, decreasing its absorption [ 3 ]. As a result, absorption of calcium is only 5% for spinach, whereas it is much higher, at 27%, for milk [ 3 ]. In addition to spinach, foods with high levels of oxalic acid include collard greens, sweet potatoes, rhubarb, and beans [ 1 ]. The bioavailability of calcium from other plants that do not contain these compounds—including broccoli, kale, and cabbage—is similar to that of milk, although the amount of calcium per serving is much lower [ 3 ]. When people eat many different types of foods, these interactions with oxalic or phytic acid probably have little or no nutritional consequences. Net absorption of dietary calcium is also reduced to a small extent by intakes of caffeine and phosphorus and to a greater extent by low status of vitamin D [ 9-11 ].\nA variety of foods and their calcium content are listed in Table 2.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) FoodData Central lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing calcium arranged by nutrient content and by food name .\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "Calcium is available in many dietary supplements, including multivitamin/mineral products and supplements containing calcium only or calcium plus vitamin D [ 14 ]. Amounts of calcium in supplements vary widely; multivitamin/mineral supplements commonly contain about 200 to 300 mg, and common amounts in calcium or calcium plus vitamin D supplements are 500 or 600 mg [ 14 ].\nThe two most common forms of calcium in supplements are calcium carbonate and calcium citrate [ 1 ]. In people with low levels of stomach acid, the solubility rate of calcium carbonate is lower, which could reduce the absorption of calcium from calcium carbonate supplements unless they are taken with a meal [ 3 ]. Calcium citrate is less dependent on stomach acid for absorption than calcium carbonate, so it can be taken without food [ 1 ]. In general, however, absorption of calcium supplements is greater when they are taken with food, regardless of whether the user’s gastric acid is low [ 3 ]. Other calcium forms in supplements include calcium sulfate, ascorbate, microcrystalline hydroxyapatite, gluconate, lactate, and phosphate [ 14 ].\nThe forms of calcium in supplements contain varying amounts of elemental calcium. For example, calcium carbonate is 40% calcium by weight, whereas calcium citrate is 21% calcium [ 1 ]. Elemental calcium is listed in the Supplement Facts panel, so consumers do not need to calculate the amount of calcium supplied by various forms of calcium in supplements.\nThe percentage of calcium absorbed from supplements, as with that from foods, depends not only on the source of calcium but also on the total amount of elemental calcium consumed at one time; as the amount increases, the percentage absorbed decreases. Absorption from supplements is highest with doses of 500 mg or less [ 15 ]. For example, the body absorbs about 36% of a 300 mg calcium dose and 28% of a 1,000 mg dose [ 16 ].\nSome individuals who take calcium supplements might experience gastrointestinal side effects, including gas, bloating, constipation, or a combination of these symptoms. Calcium carbonate appears to cause more of these side effects than calcium citrate, especially in older adults who have lower levels of stomach acid [ 1 ]. Symptoms can be alleviated by switching to a supplement containing a different form of calcium, taking smaller calcium doses more often during the day, or taking the supplement with meals.\n",

    "Cancer": "Calcium might help reduce the risk of cancer, especially in the colon and rectum [ 1 ]. However, evidence on the relationship between calcium intakes from foods or supplements and different forms of cancer is inconsistent [ 4 ].\nMost clinical trial evidence does not support a beneficial effect of calcium supplements on cancer incidence. A 4-year study of 1,500 mg calcium and 2,000 IU (50 mcg) vitamin D or placebo daily for 4 years in 2,303 healthy women age 55 years and older showed that supplementation did not reduce the risk of all types of cancer [ 41 ]. The large WHI study described above also found no effect of supplemental calcium and vitamin D on cancer incidence during the 7-year trial [ 42 ] and over a long-term median follow-up of 22.3 years [ 43 ]. In addition, a meta-analysis of 10 RCTs that included 10,496 individuals who took supplements containing 500 mg calcium or more (without vitamin D) for a mean of 3.9 years found that calcium supplementation did not change the total cancer risk [ 44 ]. However, one large clinical trial did find that calcium supplements reduce cancer risk. In this 4-year trial, by the same investigators as the 4-year trial above, 1,179 women age 55 years or older in Nebraska took 1,400 to 1,500 mg calcium alone; 1,400 to 1,500 mg calcium plus 1,100 IU (27.5 mcg) vitamin D3; or placebo daily. Cancer incidence from all causes was 60% lower in women who took the combination and 47% lower in those who took calcium-only supplements than in the placebo group [ 45 ]. Some scientists have questioned these findings because of the lack of statistical power (the studies were designed to detect differences in bone health measures, not cancer incidence), details from the investigators on the study sample, and randomization procedures [ 46 , 47 ].\nObservational evidence does not support an association between higher calcium intakes and a lower risk of cancer mortality. An analysis of data on 132,823 participants in the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort, who were followed for an average of 17.5 years, found no association between total dietary and supplemental calcium intakes and risk of cancer-related death or death from lung, colorectal, breast, or prostate cancer in men or women [ 48 ]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 22 observational studies in 2,346,368 participants age 8 and older followed for 4.6 to 28 years also found no association between total dietary and supplemental calcium intake and cancer mortality [ 49 ].\nResults from many, but not all, clinical trials also suggest that supplemental calcium alone or combined with vitamin D does not affect risk of mortality from all cancers. An RCT in 5,292 adults age 70 years or older (85% women) in the United Kingdom compared the effects of 1,000 mg calcium, 8,000 IU (200 mcg) vitamin D3, both, or placebo for 24 to 62 months [ 50 ]. Rates of cancer incidence and cancer mortality did not differ between those who did and those who did not receive calcium supplements. In the WHI trial, 36,282 postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to daily supplementation with a combination of 1,000 mg calcium and 400 IU (10 mcg) vitamin D3 or placebo [ 42 ]. After an average of 7 years, risk of cancer mortality did not differ between groups. However, over a long-term median follow-up of 22.3 years, cancer mortality was 7% lower among women who received calcium and vitamin D supplements compared with those who received placebo [ 43 ]. The meta-analysis described above of 10 RCTs that administered calcium alone and that included 10,496 individuals found no impact of calcium supplementation on cancer mortality rates [ 44 ].\nA substantial body of evidence has addressed the role of calcium in preventing colorectal cancer or its precursor, adenomas.\nMuch but not all of the observational evidence supports a link between higher calcium intakes and lower risk of colorectal cancer. A cohort study in 77,712 adults found that over a mean of 7.8 years, the highest total intake of dietary and supplemental calcium (median of 1,999 mg/day) was associated with a 26% lower risk of colon cancer than the lowest quintile (587 mg/day) but had no association with risk of rectal cancer [ 51 ]. In a dose-response meta-analysis of 15 prospective cohort studies in 1,415,597 participants (mean total dietary and supplemental calcium intake 250 to 1,900 mg/day) followed for 3.3 to 16 years, risk of colorectal cancer dropped by 8% with each 300 mg/day increase in total calcium intake [ 52 ]. Findings were similar for dietary intakes of calcium in two other meta-analyses [ 53 , 54 ].\nIn spite of the observational evidence supporting an association between higher calcium intakes and lower colorectal cancer risk, clinical trials investigating calcium supplements for prevention of colorectal cancer or adenomas have had mixed results. A 2013 follow-up study by Cauley and colleagues evaluated outcomes 4.9 years after completion of the 7-year WHI trial of 1,000 mg/day calcium plus 400 IU (10 mcg)/day vitamin D3 or placebo in 36,282 postmenopausal women [ 55 ]. Colorectal cancer rates did not differ between groups. Similarly, in a follow-up study an average of 55 months after administration of 1,200 mg/day calcium, 1,000 IU (25 mcg)/day vitamin D3, or both for 3 to 5 years in 1,121 participants, supplements had no effect on risk of recurrent adenomas [ 56 ]. However, a systematic review and meta-analysis of four RCTs (not including the 2013 study by Cauley and colleagues) found that daily supplementation with 1,200 to 2,000 mg elemental calcium for 36 to 60 months reduced the likelihood of recurrent adenomas by 11%, although the supplements had no effect on risk of advanced adenomas [ 57 ].\nSeveral observational studies have shown that the risk of prostate cancer might be higher with higher calcium intakes, but possibly only when the calcium comes from dairy foods. In an analysis of data from 2,776 men who participated in the French SU.VI.MAX (Supplementation en Vitamines et Minéraux Antioxydants) prospective study and were followed for an average of 7.7 years, prostate cancer risk was higher with higher calcium intakes [ 58 ]. The risk was 2.4 times higher in men in the highest quartile of intake (more than 1,081 mg/day) than those with the lowest quartile (less than 725 mg/day). However, in analyses of results for various sources of calcium, only calcium from dairy foods was significantly associated with prostate cancer risk (2.9 times higher in men with intakes greater than 696 mg/day than in those with intakes less than 354 mg/day); calcium intakes from nondairy sources were not significantly associated with prostate cancer risk. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of nine cohort studies in 750,275 men, the risk of prostate cancer was 2% higher for each 400 mg/day increment in total dietary and supplemental calcium intake, but nondairy and supplemental calcium intakes were not associated with prostate cancer risk [ 59 ].\nA meta-analysis included 15 epidemiological studies of calcium intake and ovarian cancer risk in 493,415 women who developed 7,453 cases of ovarian cancer [ 60 ]. In this meta-analysis, ovarian cancer risk was 20% lower in participants in the highest category of dietary calcium intakes (more than 820–1,500 mg/day, depending on the study) than the lowest intake category (less than 362–800 mg/day, depending on the study). However, the difference in risk was not statistically significant when both dietary and supplemental calcium intakes were considered.\nFor breast cancer, observational studies have had mixed findings on whether higher calcium intakes are associated with a lower risk. A meta-analysis of 11 prospective cohort studies in 872,895 women who developed 26,606 cases of breast cancer over 7 to 25 years found that women with the highest calcium intakes had an 8% lower risk of breast cancer [ 61 ]. However, the WHI (described above) found similar incidence rates of invasive breast cancer in the supplement and placebo groups [ 62 ].\nAdditional well-designed randomized trials are needed to determine whether dietary or supplemental calcium intakes increase, decrease, or have no effect on risk of cancer in general or of specific types of cancer, or on cancer mortality.\n",

    "Cardiovascular disease": "Calcium binds fatty acids, so it can reduce lipid absorption and might therefore lower CVD risk [ 1 , 4 ]. However, the findings from research on the role of dietary calcium and calcium supplements in reducing CVD have been mixed, and some evidence indicates that calcium supplements might even increase CVD risk.\nSeveral large observational studies have shown an association between lower calcium intakes and higher risk of hypertension, stroke, and atherosclerosis. For example, an analysis of 1999–2010 NHANES data from 14,408 adults (mean age 54 years) with obesity found that calcium intakes were 10% lower in adults with obesity and hypertension than in those without hypertension [ 63 ]. This association was strongest in women, adults age 20–44 years, those who did not have diabetes, and especially women age 20–44 years. A prospective cohort study that followed 41,514 adults age 40 to 69 years in Australia for 13 years found a 25% lower rate of stroke in adults in the highest calcium intake quartile (mean of 1,076 mg/day) than in the lowest quartile (mean of 641 mg/day) [ 64 ]. However, the study found no association between calcium intakes and risk of CVD mortality or myocardial infarction. The risk of atherosclerosis over 10 years in a study of 5,448 adults age 45–84 years was 27% lower in the highest quintile of calcium intake (mean of 2,157 mg/day) than in the lowest quintile (mean of 313 mg/day) [ 65 ]. Furthermore, a systematic review and meta-analysis that included 27 observational studies found no consistent dose-response relationships between total, dietary, or supplemental calcium intakes and CVD mortality [ 66 ]. Evidence on dose-response relationships between calcium intakes and risk of stroke or stroke mortality was inconsistent.\nA diet containing more calcium than the typical U.S. diet because of added low-fat or nonfat dairy products lowered systolic blood pressure by an average of 5.5 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 3.0 mmHg [ 67 ]. However, this Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet also increases intakes of other nutrients, such as potassium and magnesium, that are associated with reductions in blood pressure, so any independent contribution of calcium cannot be determined.\nSome clinical trials have shown that calcium supplements are associated with decreased hypertension risk or decreased cholesterol levels, but others have had more mixed findings. A Cochrane Review of 16 trials in 3,048 adults with a median follow-up period of 3.5 months found that calcium supplementation (typically 1,000 to 2,000 mg/day) reduced systolic blood pressure by 1.43 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 0.98 mmHg [ 68 ]. Effects were greatest in adults younger than 35 years and with doses higher than 1,500 mg/day calcium. A meta-analysis of 23 RCTs in 4,071 participants showed that calcium supplements providing 162 to 2,000 mg/day (combined with vitamin D in 10 RCTs) for 2 weeks to 5 years was associated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels that were 4.6 mg/dL lower and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels that were 1.9 mg/dL higher [ 69 ].\nFindings were mixed in two analyses of data from the WHI. One analysis of results from 35,983 women age 50 to 79 years randomly assigned to 1,000 mg/day calcium and 400 IU (10 mcg)/day vitamin D supplements or placebo for 10 years found no reduction in risk of heart failure [ 70 ]. However, the calcium and vitamin D supplements were associated with 5% lower heart failure risk in participants who had no pre-existing heart failure risk factors (coronary heart disease, diabetes, or hypertension). In another secondary analysis of data on 16,801 WHI participants, the supplements had no association with atrial fibrillation risk [ 71 ]. An analysis of long-term health outcomes from the WHI over a median follow-up of 22.3 years found no effect of calcium and vitamin D supplements on cardiovascular disease risk [ 43 ]. Similarly, an evidence report and systematic review conducted for the USPSTF that included 11 RCTs of vitamin D, calcium, or both for 2 to 7 years in 51,419 adults age 50 years and older found that supplementation with vitamin D alone or combined with calcium had no effect on CVD incidence [ 39 ].\nIn contrast, several prospective cohort studies and RCTs have shown that calcium supplements increase the risk of CVD. A meta-analysis of 14 RCTs (including one study that administered supplements providing 20 mcg [800 IU] vitamin D per day) in 28,935 healthy postmenopausal women found that calcium supplements providing 500 to 2,000 mg/day calcium for 1 to 7 years increased CVD risk by 15% and coronary heart disease risk by 16% [ 72 ]. In addition, when 132,823 adults (mean age 63 years) were followed for an average of 17.5 years, the risk of CVD mortality was 22% higher in men with calcium supplement intakes of 1,000 mg/day or more than in those not taking calcium supplements [ 48 ]. However, in women, the CVD mortality rate was 16% lower with supplemental calcium intakes of 1,000 mg/day than with no supplemental calcium intakes. An analysis of long-term health outcomes from the WHI over a median follow-up of 22.3 years found that women who received calcium and vitamin D supplements had a 6% higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease than those who received placebo [ 43 ].\nOther studies have found no association between calcium supplements and CVD risk or CVD outcomes. After 24 years of follow-up of 74,245 women age 30 to 55 years at baseline who participated in the Nurses’ Health Study, women taking more than 1,000 mg/day calcium supplements did not have a higher risk of CVD than those taking no supplemental calcium [ 73 ].\nAn expert panel convened by the National Osteoporosis Foundation and American Society for Preventive Cardiology determined, on the basis of moderate-quality evidence, that calcium intakes with or without vitamin D from foods or supplements neither increase nor decrease the risk of CVD or CVD mortality [ 74 ]. The societies therefore concluded that calcium intakes that do not exceed the UL are safe \"from a cardiovascular standpoint.\"\n",

    "Calcium Intakes and Status": "A substantial proportion of people in the United States consume less than recommended amounts of calcium. An analysis of 2007–2010 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that 49% of children age 4–18 years and 39% of all individuals age 4 and older consume less than the EAR for calcium from foods and supplements [ 17 ].\nAverage daily intakes of calcium from foods and beverages are 1,083 mg for men age 20 and older and 842 mg for women [ 18 ]. For children age 2–19, mean daily intakes of calcium from foods and beverages range from 965 to 1,015 mg [ 18 ]. Approximately 22% of men, 32% of women, and 4% to 8% of children take a dietary supplement containing calcium [ 18 ]. Average daily calcium intakes from both foods and supplements are 1,156 mg for men, 1,009 mg for women, and 968 to 1,020 mg for children [ 18 ].\nAccording to 2009–2012 NHANES data, rates of calcium inadequacy (intakes below the EAR) are higher among non-Hispanic Blacks and non-Hispanic Asians (47%–48%) than among Hispanics (30%) and non-Hispanic Whites (24%) in the United States [ 19 ]. Poverty is also associated with a higher risk of inadequacy. NHANES data from 2007 to 2014 show that the risk of inadequate calcium intakes (less than 800 to 1,100 mg) is 11.6% higher among adults age 50 and older in households earning less than $20,000 per year than other households [ 20 ].\n",
    "Calcium Deficiency": "Calcium deficiency can reduce bone strength and lead to osteoporosis, which is characterized by fragile bones and an increased risk of falling [ 1 ]. Calcium deficiency can also cause rickets in children and other bone disorders in adults, although these disorders are more commonly caused by vitamin D deficiency. In children with rickets, the growth cartilage does not mineralize normally, which can lead to irreversible changes in the skeletal structure [ 1 ]. Another effect of chronic calcium deficiency is osteomalacia, or defective bone mineralization and bone softening, which can occur in adults and children [ 1 ]. For rickets and osteomalacia, the requirements for calcium and vitamin D appear to be interrelated in that the lower the serum vitamin D level (measured as 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]), the more calcium is needed to prevent these diseases [ 21 ].\nHypocalcemia (serum calcium level less than 8.5 mg/dL [2.12 mmol/L] or an ionized calcium level below 4.61 mg/dL [1.15 mmol/L]) is usually a result of a vitamin D or magnesium deficiency, impaired parathyroid hormone production leading to hypoparathyroidism, impaired bone resorption of calcium, critical illness, or use of certain medications (e.g., bisphosphonates, cisplatin, or proton pump inhibitors) [ 22 , 23 ]. Hypocalcemia can be asymptomatic, especially when it is mild or chronic [ 23 ]. When signs and symptoms do occur, they can range widely because low serum calcium levels can affect most organs and symptoms [ 24 ]. The most common symptom is increased neuromuscular irritability, including perioral numbness, tingling in the hands and feet, and muscle spasms [ 23 ]. More severe signs and symptoms can include renal calcification or injury; brain calcification; neurologic symptoms (e.g., depression and bipolar disorder); cataracts; congestive heart failure; paresthesia; seizures; and, in rare cases, coma [ 22 , 24 ].\n",
    "Groups at Risk of Calcium Inadequacy": "The following groups are among those most likely to need extra calcium.\n",
    "Postmenopausal women": "Menopause leads to bone loss because decreases in estrogen production reduce calcium absorption and increase urinary calcium loss and calcium resorption from bone [ 1 ]. On average, women lose approximately 1% of their bone mineral density (BMD) per year after menopause [ 25 ]. Over time, these changes lead to decreased bone mass and fragile bones [ 1 ]. About 30% of postmenopausal women in the United States and Europe have osteoporosis, and at least 40% of those with this condition develop at least one fragility fracture (a fracture that occurs after minor trauma, such as a fall from standing height or lower) [ 26 ]. The calcium RDA is 1,200 mg for women older than 50 years (vs. 1,000 mg for younger women) to lessen bone loss after menopause [ 1 ].\n",
    "Individuals who avoid dairy products": "People with lactose intolerance, those with an allergy to milk, and those who avoid eating dairy products (including vegans) have a higher risk of inadequate calcium intakes because dairy products are rich sources of calcium [ 1 , 27 ]. Options for increasing calcium intakes in individuals with lactose intolerance include consuming lactose-free or reduced-lactose dairy products, which contain the same amounts of calcium as regular dairy products [ 1 , 3 ]. Those who avoid dairy products because of allergies or for other reasons can obtain calcium from nondairy sources, such as some vegetables (e.g., kale, broccoli, and Chinese cabbage [bok choi]), canned fish with bones, or fortified foods (e.g., fruit juices, breakfast cereals, and tofu) [ 1 ]. However, these individuals typically need to eat foods fortified with calcium or take supplements to obtain recommended amounts [ 28 ].\n",
    "Calcium and Health": "This section focuses on six health conditions and diseases in which calcium might play a role: bone health in older adults, cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), preeclampsia, weight management, and metabolic syndrome.\n",
    "Bone health in older adults": "Bone is constantly being remodeled. Declining levels of estrogen in women during menopause and for approximately 5 years afterward lead to rates of bone resorption that are higher than rates of bone formation, resulting in a rapid decrease in bone mass [ 7 ]. Over time, postmenopausal women can develop osteoporosis, in which bone strength is compromised because of lower BMD and bone quality [ 1 ]. Age-related bone loss can also occur in men and lead to osteoporosis, but fracture risk tends to increase in older men about 5 to 10 years later than in older women [ 1 ]. Osteoporosis increases the risk of fractures, especially of the hip, vertebrae, and forearms [ 1 , 7 ].\nFDA has approved a health claim for the use of supplements containing calcium and vitamin D to reduce the risk of osteoporosis [ 29 ]. However, not all research supports this claim.\nIn spite of the importance of calcium in bone health, observational evidence is mixed on the link between calcium intakes and measures of bone strength in older adults. Support for such a link comes from an analysis of 2001–2006 NHANES cross-sectional data on 2,904 adults age 60 and older (54.6% women) showing an association between higher dietary calcium intakes and greater lumbar spine BMD, but only in women [ 30 ]. In contrast, an analysis of baseline data from a randomized trial in Australia in 1,994 women older than 65 years whose average dietary calcium intake was 886 mg/day found no association between quintile of calcium intake and BMD at any site, even after adjustment for such factors as age, physical activity, height, and weight [ 31 ]. Results were similar in 698 of the women who were followed for 6 years, even though mean daily intakes of calcium dropped by an average of 40 mg during this period.\nSome but not all clinical trials have found that calcium supplementation can improve bone health in older adults. A post-hoc analysis of data from a double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 1,000 mg elemental calcium in the form of calcium carbonate and 400 International Units (IU) (10 microgram [mcg]) vitamin D3 daily or placebo in 36,282 women age 50–79 years enrolled in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) found that the supplementation did not prevent height loss after a mean follow-up period of 5.9 years [ 32 ]. On average, women lost 1.28 mm/year of height in the supplementation group and 1.26 mm/year in the placebo group. However, a 2-year RCT in 500 healthy postmenopausal women showed that daily intakes of 500 ml/day skimmed milk enriched to provide 900 mg calcium and 15 mcg (600 IU) vitamin D led to increased BMD at the femoral neck [ 33 ].\nSeveral recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have found that supplementation with calcium alone or a combination of calcium and vitamin D increases BMD in older adults. For example, a systematic review and meta-analysis included 15 RCTs in postmenopausal women (but did not include the two studies described in the previous paragraph) in 78,206 women, of which 37,412 were in the intervention group and 40,794 were in the control group [ 34 ]. Supplementation with both calcium and vitamin D or consumption of dairy products fortified with both nutrients increased total BMD as well as BMD at the lumbar spine, arms, and femoral neck. However, in subgroup analyses, calcium had no effect on femoral neck BMD. Earlier systematic reviews and meta-analyses found a positive relationship between calcium and vitamin D supplementation and increased BMD in older males [ 35 ] and between higher calcium intakes from dietary sources or supplements and higher BMD in adults older than 50 [ 25 ]. However, whether these BMD increases were clinically significant is not clear.\nAs with the evidence on the link between increased calcium intakes and reductions in BMD loss, the findings of research on the use of calcium supplementation to prevent fractures in older adults are mixed.\nFor the most part, the observational evidence does not show that increasing calcium intakes reduces the risk of fractures and falls in older adults. For example, a longitudinal cohort study of 1,490 women age 42 to 52 years at baseline who were followed for 10–12 years found that fracture risk was not significantly different in calcium supplement users (some of whom also took vitamin D supplements) and nonusers, even though supplement use was associated with less BMD loss throughout the study period [ 36 ].\nSome clinical trial evidence shows that supplements containing a combination of calcium and vitamin D can reduce the risk of fractures in older adults. For example, a meta-analysis of 8 RCTs in 30,970 adults older than 50 years found that 500 to 1,200 mg/day calcium and 400 to 800 IU/day (10 to 20 mcg/day) vitamin D supplementation for 1 to 7 years reduced the risk of total fractures by 15% and hip fractures by 30% [ 37 ]. However, findings were negative in another systematic review and meta-analysis that included 14 RCTs of calcium supplementation and 13 trials comparing calcium and vitamin D supplements with hormone therapy, placebo, or no treatment in participants older than 50 years [ 38 ]. The results showed that calcium supplementation alone had no effect on risk of hip fracture, and supplementation with both calcium and vitamin D had no effect on risk of hip fracture, nonvertebral fracture, vertebral fracture, or total fracture. Similarly, a systematic review of 11 RCTs in 51,419 adults age 50 and older found that supplementation with vitamin D and calcium for 2 to 7 years had no impact on risk of total fractures or of hip fractures [ 39 ].\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concluded with moderate certainty that daily doses of less than 1,000 mg calcium and less than 400 IU (10 mcg) vitamin D do not prevent fractures in postmenopausal women and that the evidence on larger doses of this combination is inadequate to assess the benefits in this population [ 40 ]. The USPSTF also determined the evidence on the benefits of calcium supplementation alone or with vitamin D to be inadequate to assess its effect on preventing fractures in men and premenopausal women.\nAdditional research is needed before conclusions can be drawn about the use of calcium supplements to improve bone health and prevent fractures in older adults.\n",
    "Preeclampsia": "Preeclampsia is defined as hypertension and proteinuria or thrombocytopenia during pregnancy, usually after 20 weeks’ gestation [ 75 ]. It is a leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality that affects about 4% of pregnancies in the United States [ 76 ].\nCalcium supplementation during pregnancy might reduce the risk of preeclampsia, but the benefits might apply only to women with inadequate calcium intakes, and much of this evidence comes from studies with methodological weaknesses [ 77 , 78 ].\nA Cochrane Review included 27 RCTs of calcium supplements during pregnancy in 18,064 women to prevent hypertensive disorders and related problems [ 79 ]. In the 13 studies—none of which administered vitamin D supplements—that evaluated high doses (at least 1,000 mg/day calcium) in 15,730 women, supplementation reduced the risk of high blood pressure by 35% and, in women with low dietary calcium intakes (less than 900 mg/day; 8 trials in 10,678 women), the risk of preeclampsia by 64%. However, the quality of this evidence was low. In 12 trials in 2,334 women, doses of less than 1,000 mg/day (usually 500 mg/day) reduced the risk of high blood pressure by 47% and of preeclampsia by 62%. However, most of these studies recruited women at high risk of preeclampsia and had a high risk of bias. An earlier systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 RCTs in 24,787 women also found that calcium supplementation (1,500 to 2,000 mg/day) reduced the risk of preeclampsia by 38% and, in women at increased risk of any hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, by 64% [ 80 ]. However, when the analysis was restricted to trials with 4,000 or more women, the effect was no longer statistically significant. An RCT in 1,355 women in Argentina, South Africa, and Zimbabwe also found that 500 mg/day calcium supplementation starting before conception made no difference in the risk of preeclampsia [ 81 , 82 ].\nSeveral professional organizations recommend calcium supplements during pregnancy for women with low calcium intakes to reduce the risk of preeclampsia. For example, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology states that daily supplementation with 1,500–2,000 mg calcium might reduce the severity of preeclampsia in pregnant women who have calcium intakes of less than 600 mg/day [ 77 ]. The World Health Organization recommends 1,500–2,000 mg/day calcium for pregnant women with low dietary calcium intakes to reduce preeclampsia risk [ 83 ]. The Canadian Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy Working Group [ 84 ], the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy [ 85 ], and the Society of Obstetric Medicine of Australia and New Zealand [ 86 ] have similar recommendations.\n",
    "Weight management": "Observational and clinical trial evidence linking higher calcium intakes from dairy products or supplements to lower body weight or less weight gain over time is mixed.\nAn observational study found an association between higher calcium intakes and lower prevalence of overweight or obesity in 6,696 children (51% male, mean age 6 years) in eight European countries, of whom 2,744 were re-examined 6 years later [ 87 ]. The prevalence of overweight or obesity at 6-year follow-up was lower in boys (16%) and girls (18%) in the highest tertile of calcium intake (664 mg/1,000 kcal for boys and 667 mg/1,000 kcal for girls) than in boys (26%) and girls (25%) in the lowest tertile (249 mg/1,000 kcal for both boys and girls). In contrast, a longitudinal study in 2,159 participants in Portugal evaluated at ages 13 and 21 years found no association between total dietary and supplemental calcium intake at age 13 and body mass index (BMI) at age 21 after the analysis was adjusted for energy intake [ 88 ]. The study also found no associations between consumption of dairy foods (milk, yogurt, and cheese) at age 13 and BMI at age 21.\nClinical trials and meta-analyses of RCTs assessing the impact of calcium supplements or increased intakes of calcium from dairy products on prevention of weight gain or promotion of fat loss or weight loss have had mixed results [ 89-93 ]. For example, postmenopausal women who took 1,000 mg calcium and 400 IU (10 mcg) vitamin D daily for 3 years in the WHI whose daily intakes were less than 1,200 mg calcium at baseline were 11% less likely to gain 1 kg of weight or more than those who took placebo during this period [ 91 ]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 41 RCTs that examined the effect of dairy foods or calcium supplements (at least 300 mg/day) in 4,802 adults found that higher calcium intakes from dairy foods had no impact on body weight or body fat, although they did reduce body fat when combined with an energy-restricted diet [ 92 ]. In addition, calcium supplements had no effect on body weight or body fat.\nFor additional information on calcium and weight management, see the health professional fact sheet on weight loss .\n",
    "Metabolic syndrome": "Metabolic syndrome is a set of at least three risk factors for heart disease, stroke, and diabetes—large waistline, high triglyceride level, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, high blood pressure, and high fasting blood sugar level. Some observational evidence links higher calcium intakes with lower risk of metabolic syndrome.\nAn analysis of 2001–2010 NHANES data on 9,148 adults found that women in the highest quintile (at least 1,172 mg/day) of calcium intake, based on 24-hour recall, had a 27% lower risk of metabolic syndrome than those in the lowest quintile (less than 547 mg/day) [ 94 ]. Furthermore, women who met the RDA for calcium for adults (1,000 to 1,200 mg/day, depending on age) had an 18% lower risk of metabolic syndrome, but the association was not statistically significant in men who met the RDA for calcium. In a meta-analysis of eight cross-sectional studies and two prospective cohort studies in 63,017 participants age 20 years and older, 14,906 participants developed metabolic syndrome [ 95 ]. For each 300 mg/day increase in dietary calcium intake, risk of metabolic syndrome dropped by 7%. Subgroup analyses suggested that the inverse association between dietary calcium intakes and metabolic syndrome risk was stronger in women than men.\nClinical trial evidence on the link between calcium and metabolic syndrome is very limited. In one placebo-controlled clinical trial in Iran in 66 adults who were overweight and had type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease, supplements of 5 mcg (200 IU) vitamin D, 90 mcg vitamin K, and 500 mg calcium for 12 weeks significantly reduced maximum levels of left carotid intima media thickness and improved metabolic status (including improvements in insulin resistance, insulin concentrations, beta-cell function, and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index) [ 96 ].\nMore evidence, including from well-designed clinical trials, is needed to determine whether higher intakes of calcium can reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome.\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Calcium": "Hypercalcemia (serum levels greater than 10.5 mg/dL [2.63 mmol/L]) and hypercalciuria (urinary calcium levels higher than 250 mg/day in women and 275 mg/day in men) are rare in healthy people and usually result from cancer, primary hyperparathyroidism, and other conditions [ 1 , 4 ]. Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria can cause poor muscle tone, renal insufficiency, hypophosphatemia, constipation, nausea, weight loss, fatigue, polyuria, heart arrhythmias, and a higher risk of CVD mortality [ 1 , 4 , 49 ].\nHigh calcium intakes might also increase the risk of CVD (see section on CVD in Calcium and Health section above) [ 39 , 63 , 68 , 70 , 71 ] and prostate cancer (see Other Cancers in Calcium and Health section above for more details) [ 58 , 59 ], although not all studies confirm these findings.\nThe ULs for calcium established by the FNB are listed in Table 3. They are based on observational evidence from the WHI showing a link between higher intakes of supplemental calcium (1,000 mg/day for 7 years) and a greater risk of kidney stones [ 97 , 98 ]. However, two subsequent systematic reviews of the evidence from 10 studies in more than 8,000 adults with osteoporosis who took 120 to 1,500 mg supplemental calcium daily for 3 days to 3 years [ 99 ] and 11 RCTs in 51,419 adults 50 years and older who took 1,000 to 1,600 mg calcium with or without vitamin D for 2 to 7 years [ 39 ] found no such association.\n",
    "Dolutegravir": "Dolutegravir (Dovato, Tivicay) is an HIV integrase inhibitor used in adults and children. Concomitant use of calcium supplements and dolutegravir can reduce blood levels of dolutegravir substantially, apparently through chelation [ 100 , 101 ]. The labels approved by the FDA for dolutegravir advise patients to take dolutegravir 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking calcium supplements [ 102 , 103 ].\n",
    "Levothyroxine": "Calcium carbonate supplements can interfere with the absorption of levothyroxine (Synthroid, Levoxyl, and others), a thyroid hormone used to treat hypothyroidism and thyroid cancer [ 104-106 ]. The FDA-approved label for this medication instructs patients taking calcium carbonate supplements to avoid taking levothyroxine within 4 hours of taking the supplement [ 107 ].\n",
    "Lithium": "Long-term use of lithium (Eskalith, Lithobid), a treatment for bipolar disorder, can lead to hypercalcemia, and use of both lithium and calcium supplements could increase this risk [ 108 ].\n",
    "Quinolone antibiotics": "Simultaneous use of calcium supplements and quinolone antibiotics—such as ciprofloxacin (Cipro), gemifloxacin (Factive), and moxifloxacin (Avelox)—can reduce the absorption of quinolones [ 109 , 110 ]. Taking the antibiotic 2 hours before or 2 hours after calcium supplements prevents this effect [ 109 ].\n",
    "Calcium and Healthful Diets": "The federal government’s 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate .\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy eating pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products, and oils. Many dairy products, such as milk, cheese, and yogurt, are rich sources of calcium. Some vegetables provide significant amounts of calcium, as do some fortified cereals and juices. Includes a variety of protein foods, including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans and peas), nuts, seeds, and soy products. Tofu made with calcium salts is a good source of calcium (check the label), as are canned sardines and canned salmon with edible bones. Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Limits alcoholic beverages.

    "Table of Contents": "Introduction Recommended Intakes Sources of Choline Choline Intakes and Status Choline Deficiency Groups at Risk of Choline Inadequacy Choline and Health Health Risks from Excessive Choline Interactions with Medications Choline and Healthful Diets References Disclaimer\nThis is a fact sheet intended for health professionals.  For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet .\n",
    "Introduction": "Choline is an essential nutrient that is naturally present in some foods and available as a dietary supplement. Choline is a source of methyl groups needed for many steps in metabolism. The body needs choline to synthesize phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, two major phospholipids vital for cell membranes. Therefore, all plant and animal cells need choline to preserve their structural integrity [ 1 , 2 ]. In addition, choline is needed to produce acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter for memory, mood, muscle control, and other brain and nervous system functions [ 1-3 ]. Choline also plays important roles in modulating gene expression, cell membrane signaling, lipid transport and metabolism, and early brain development [ 1 , 2 ].\nHumans can produce choline endogenously in the liver, mostly as phosphatidylcholine, but the amount that the body naturally synthesizes is not sufficient to meet human needs [ 4 ]. As a result, humans must obtain some choline from the diet. Premenopausal women might need less choline from the diet than children or other adults because estrogen induces the gene that catalyzes the biosynthesis of choline [ 4 ]. When a diet is deficient in folate, a B-vitamin that is also a methyl donor, the need for dietary choline rises because choline becomes the primary methyl donor [ 1 ].\nThe most common sources of choline in foods are the fat-soluble phospholipids phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin as well as the water-soluble compounds phosphocholine, glycerolphosphocholine, and free choline [ 1 ]. When these choline-containing compounds are ingested, pancreatic and mucosal enzymes liberate free choline from about half of the fat-soluble forms and some water-soluble forms [ 5 ]. Free choline, phosphocholine, and glycerophosphocholine are absorbed in the small intestine, enter the portal circulation, and are stored in the liver, where they are subsequently phosphorylated and distributed throughout the body to make cell membranes [ 1-3 ]. The remaining fat-soluble phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin) are absorbed intact, incorporated into chylomicrons, and secreted into the lymphatic circulation, where they are distributed to tissues and other organs, including the brain and placenta [ 1 , 6 ].\nCholine status is not routinely measured in healthy people. In healthy adults, the concentration of choline in plasma ranges from 7 to 20 mcmol/L [ 2 ]. According to one study, the range is 7–9.3 mcmol/L in fasting adults [ 7 ]. Plasma choline levels do not decline below 50% of normal, even in individuals who have not eaten for more than a week [ 3 ]. This may be due to the hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids, a source of choline, to maintain plasma choline concentrations above this minimal level, or to endogenous synthesis [ 2 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for choline and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the Institute of Medicine [ 2 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nInsufficient data were available to establish an EAR for choline, so the FNB established AIs for all ages that are based on the prevention of liver damage as measured by serum alanine aminostransferase levels [ 2 ]. The amount of choline that individuals need is influenced by the amount of methionine, betaine, and folate in the diet; gender; pregnancy; lactation; stage of development; ability to produce choline endogenously; and genetic mutations that affect choline needs [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 ]. Table 1 lists the current AIs for choline [ 2 ].\n",
    "Food": "Many foods contain choline [ 4 ]. The main dietary sources of choline in the United States consist primarily of animal-based products that are particularly rich in choline—meat, poultry, fish, dairy products, and eggs [ 4 , 5 , 8-10 ]. Cruciferous vegetables and certain beans are also rich in choline, and other dietary sources of choline include nuts, seeds, and whole grains.\nAbout half the dietary choline consumed in the United States is in the form of phosphatidylcholine [ 8 , 9 ]. Many foods also contain lecithin, a substance rich in phosphatidylcholine that is prepared during commercial purification of phospholipids; lecithin is a common food additive used as an emulsifying agent in processed foods, such as gravies, salad dressings, and margarine [ 1 , 3 ]. Choline is also present in breast milk and is added to most commercial infant formulas [ 3 , 4 ]. Precise estimates of the percentage absorption of the different forms of dietary choline in humans are not available [ 2 , 3 ].\nSeveral food sources of choline are listed in Table 2.\n*DV = Daily Value. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for choline is 550 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 12 ]. FDA does not require food labels to list choline content unless choline has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) FoodData Central [ 11 ] lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing choline arranged by nutrient content .\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "Choline is available in dietary supplements containing choline only, in combination with B-complex vitamins, and in some multivitamin/mineral products [ 13 ]. Typical amounts of choline in dietary supplements range from 10 mg to 250 mg. The forms of choline in dietary supplements include choline bitartrate, phosphatidylcholine, and lecithin. No studies have compared the relative bioavailability of choline from these different forms.\n",

    "Choline Intakes and Status": "Most people in the United States consume less than the AI for choline. An analysis of data from the 2013–2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that the average daily choline intake from foods and beverages among children and teens is 256 mg for ages 2–19 [ 14 ]. In adults, the average daily choline intake from foods and beverages is 402 mg in men and 278 mg in women. Intakes from supplements contribute a very small amount to total choline intakes.\nAccording to an analysis of 2007–2008 NHANES data, black males of all ages had lower mean choline intakes than their white and Hispanic counterparts, but choline intakes did not differ substantially among females of different races/ethnicities [ 10 ].\n",
    "Choline Deficiency": "Choline deficiency can cause muscle damage, liver damage, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD or hepatosteatosis) [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 15 ]. Although most people in the United States consume less than the AI of choline, frank choline deficiency in healthy men and nonpregnant women is very rare, possibly because of the contribution of choline that the body synthesizes endogenously [ 1 , 5 ].\n",
    "Groups at Risk of Choline Inadequacy": "The following groups are among those most likely to have inadequate choline status.\n",
    "Pregnant women": "Approximately 90%–95% of pregnant women consume less choline than the AI [ 16 ]. Prenatal dietary supplements typically contain little if any choline [ 17 ]. The risk of inadequate choline status might be greater in pregnant and lactating women who do not take folic acid supplements, those with low vitamin B12 status, and those with a common variant in methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (an enzyme that can affect folate status), all of which reduce the body’s pool of methyl groups needed for metabolism [ 17-20 ].\nSome evidence indicates that lower plasma or serum choline levels (e.g., serum concentration of 2.77 mmol/L in midpregnancy) are associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects [ 21 , 22 ]. However, other research found no relationship between plasma choline concentrations during pregnancy and neural tube defects in offspring [ 23 ].\n",
    "People with certain genetic alterations": "Genes involved in the metabolism of choline, folate, and methionine play a role in the pathways for choline production and use [ 24 , 25 ]. Humans have variations in the DNA sequences for these genes (single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]), and these SNPs can have a strong influence on demands for dietary choline. For example, one common SNP in the PEMT gene reduces endogenous synthesis of choline in women induced by estrogen [ 26 ]. The prevalence of SNPs that alter requirements for dietary choline vary by race. In a study of 100 African, Asian, Caucasian, and Mexican Americans, individuals of European ancestry had a higher prevalence of four SNPs that increased the risk of organ dysfunction when these individuals consumed a low-choline diet [ 27 ].\n",
    "Patients requiring total parenteral nutrition": "At present, choline is not routinely added to commercial parenteral solutions for infants and adults [ 28 , 29 ]. As a result, adults and infants receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) over the long term have low plasma choline concentrations (approximately 5 nmol/ml in adults and 5.7 nmol/ml in infants), which can result in hepatic abnormalities, including NAFLD [ 30-32 ]. The American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition recommends the routine addition of choline to adult and pediatric parenteral nutrition formulations and calls for the development of a commercially available parenteral product that contains choline [ 28 ].\n",
    "Choline and Health": "This section focuses on three conditions in which choline might play a role: cardiovascular and peripheral artery disease, neurological disorders, and NAFLD. Choline is involved in functions that overlap with those of folate and other B vitamins. Many studies do not assess the status of all B vitamins, which can confound results and obscure the true relationship between choline and the observed outcome.\n",
    "Cardiovascular and peripheral artery disease": "Some researchers have suggested that choline might protect cardiovascular health by reducing blood pressure, altering lipid profiles, and reducing levels of plasma homocysteine [ 3 ]. Other research suggests that higher dietary choline might increase cardiovascular disease risk because some choline and other dietary ingredients, such as carnitine, are converted to trimethylamine (TMA) by intestinal bacteria. The TMA is then absorbed and converted by the liver into trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a substance that has been linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease [ 33 , 34 ].\nDespite the hypothesis that choline might affect heart health, several large observational studies have found no significant associations between choline intakes and cardiovascular or peripheral artery disease risk. An analysis of 72,348 women in the Nurses’ Health Study and 44,504 men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study showed no association between choline intake and risk of peripheral artery disease in men or women [ 35 ]. Similarly, a prospective study in 14,430 middle-age adults in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study found that over 14 years, risk of coronary heart disease was not significantly different in the highest choline intake quartile compared to the lowest quartile [ 36 ]. Choline intakes also had no association with cardiovascular disease risk in a study of 16,165 women participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition [ 37 ].\nHowever, a more recent analysis of data on 80,978 women from the Nurses’ Health Study and 39,434 men from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study found an increased risk of mortality in those consuming higher levels of choline [ 33 ]. The authors suggest that the higher risk might be due to increased production of TMAO, although they did not directly measure TMAO.\nAdditional research is needed to determine the relationship between choline intakes and cardiovascular and peripheral artery disease as well as the potential risks and benefits of choline supplementation to reduce the risk of these diseases.\n",
    "Neurological disorders": "People with Alzheimer’s disease have lower levels of the enzyme that converts choline into acetylcholine in the brain [ 38 ]. In addition, because phosphatidylcholine can serve as a phospholipid precursor, it might help support the structural integrity of neurons and thus might promote cognitive function in elderly adults [ 8 ]. Some experts have therefore theorized that consuming higher levels of phosphatidylcholine could reduce the progression of dementia in people with Alzheimer’s disease [ 38 ]. However, little research conducted to date supports this hypothesis, as described below.\nA few observational studies have shown a link between cognitive performance in adults and both higher choline intakes and plasma concentrations. In one observational study in 2,195 adults age 70–74 years in Norway, participants with plasma free choline concentrations lower than 8.4 mcmol/L (20th percentile of concentrations in the study population) had poorer sensorimotor speed, perceptual speed, executive function, and global cognition than those with choline concentrations higher than 8.4 mcmol/L [ 39 ]. A second study in 1,391 adults age 36–83 years from the Framingham Offspring study who completed food frequency questionnaires from 1991 to 1995 and again from 1998 to 2001 found that those with higher choline intakes had better verbal memory and visual memory [ 40 ]. Furthermore, higher choline intakes during the earlier period were associated with smaller white matter hyperintensity volume (a high volume is a sign of small-vessel disease in the brain).\nSome small randomized intervention trials have shown that choline supplements improve cognitive performance in adults [ 30 , 41 ]. However, a 2015 systematic review of 13 studies on the relationship between choline levels and neurological outcomes in adults found that choline supplements did not result in clear improvements in cognition in healthy adults [ 8 ]. Similarly, a 2003 Cochrane Review of 12 randomized trials in 265 patients with Alzheimer’s disease, 21 with Parkinsonian dementia, and 90 with self-identified memory problems found no clear clinical benefits of lecithin supplementation for treating Alzheimer’s disease or Parkinsonian dementia [ 38 ].\nFuture studies are needed to clarify the relationship between choline intakes and cognitive function and determine whether choline supplements might benefit patients with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia.\n",
    "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease": "NAFLD involves the accumulation of lipids in the livers of people who consume less than 20 g/day ethanol and who have no other known causes of steatosis [ 42 , 43 ]. (A single drink [e.g., 12 oz beer, 5 oz wine, or 1.5 oz hard liquor] contains about 12–14 g alcohol.) It is the most common chronic liver disorder, present in up to 65% of individuals who are overweight and 90% of those with obesity [ 1 ]. Although it is often benign, NAFLD can lead to steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer [ 15 ]. Choline, especially phosphatidylcholine, is essential for transporting lipids from the liver [ 1 ]. Therefore, in choline deficiency, fat accumulates in the liver, which can result in NAFLD [ 44 , 45 ]. Although most women of childbearing age are resistant to NAFLD because of their high estrogen levels, at least 40% have a polymorphism that makes them insensitive to activation of the gene by estrogen; adequate consumption of dietary choline is particularly important for this population [ 46 ].\nData from a single large observational study support a link between choline deficiency and risk of NAFLD. Specifically, a cross-sectional study of 56,195 Chinese adults age 40–75 years found an inverse relationship between dietary choline intakes and risk of NAFLD based on 24-hour dietary recall [ 47 ]. The risk of NAFLD was 32% lower in women in the highest quintile of choline intake (412 mg/day) compared to the lowest (179 mg/day) and 25% lower in men in the highest (452 mg/day) quintile compared to those in the lowest (199 mg/day). However, choline intake was associated with NAFLD in normal-weight women only and not in those with overweight or obesity. This difference by weight status was not observed in men.\nIn a cross-sectional study of 664 adults and children from the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network, postmenopausal women who had nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (an extreme form of NAFLD involving liver inflammation and fibrosis) and a choline intake less than 50% of the AI had more severe fibrosis, but the results showed no relationship between choline intake and degree of liver steatosis [ 48 ].\nOnly limited data are available on the use of choline to treat NAFLD. For example, in a study of 57 adults who consumed a diet that included less than 50 mg choline per 70 kg body weight per day (<10% of the AI) for up to 42 days, 37 of the participants developed liver dysfunction [ 45 ]. Liver function returned to normal in 29 participants in this study after they were fed a diet containing 25%–75% of the choline AI and in eight who consumed an ad libitum diet. A pilot study in 15 adults on TPN found that NAFLD resolved completely in all patients who received their usual TPN regimen with an additional 2 g choline and in none of the patients who received their usual TPN regimen only [ 49 ].\nAdequate choline intake is needed for proper liver function and to prevent NAFLD, but more research is needed to further clarify the role of choline in preventing or treating NAFLD [ 50 ].\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Choline": "High intakes of choline are associated with a fishy body odor, vomiting, excessive sweating and salivation, hypotension, and liver toxicity [ 1 , 2 ]. Choline consumption has been shown to increase production of TMAO, a substance that has been linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, in a dose-dependent manner in adults.\nThe FNB has established ULs for choline from food and supplements based on the amounts of choline that are associated with hypotension and fishy body odor (see Table 3) [ 2 ]. The ULs apply to healthy children and adults but not to those taking high doses of choline under medical supervision. The FNB was unable to establish ULs for infants due to the lack of data on adverse effects in this age group.\n*Not possible to establish; breast milk, formula, and food should be the only sources of choline for infants.\n",
    "Choline and Healthful Diets": "The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Many vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and dairy products contain choline. Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. Fish, beef, poultry, eggs, and some beans and nuts are rich sources of choline. Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Limits alcoholic beverages. Stays within your daily calorie needs.\nMany vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and dairy products contain choline.\nFish, beef, poultry, eggs, and some beans and nuts are rich sources of choline.\n",

    "Table of Contents": "Introduction Recommended Intakes Sources of Chromium Chromium Intakes and Status Chromium Deficiency Chromium and Health Health Risks from Excessive Chromium Interactions with Medications Chromium and Healthful Diets References Disclaimer\nThis is a fact sheet intended for health professionals.  For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet .\n",
    "Introduction": "Chromium, as trivalent (+3) chromium, is a trace element that is naturally present in many foods and available as a dietary supplement. Chromium also exists as hexavalent (+6) chromium, a toxic by-product of stainless steel and other manufacturing processes [ 1 , 2 ]. This fact sheet focuses entirely on trivalent chromium.\nChromium might play a role in carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism by potentiating insulin action [ 1-5 ]. Although the precise mechanism for this activity has not been identified, scientists have proposed that chromium binds to an oligopeptide to form chromodulin, a low-molecular-weight, chromium-binding substance that binds to and activates the insulin receptor to promote insulin action [ 4 , 6-8 ]. Chromium might also have antioxidant effects [ 1 ].\nIn 2001, the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine considered chromium to be an essential nutrient based on its effects on insulin action [ 2 ]. However, recent research has suggested that although chromium might have benefits at pharmacologic amounts (e.g., in the hundreds of mcg), it is not an essential mineral because an absence or deficiency of chromium does not produce abnormalities that can be reversed with the addition of chromium (see the Chromium Deficiency section below) [ 5 , 9-13 ]. The FNB has not evaluated chromium since 2001. However, in 2014, the European Food Safety Authority Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies concluded that no convincing evidence shows that chromium is an essential nutrient and, therefore, setting chromium intake recommendations would be inappropriate [ 5 ].\nIn the blood, most chromium is bound to plasma proteins, particularly transferrin, and only about 5% is unbound [ 5 , 12 ]. Chromium accumulates mainly in the liver, spleen, soft tissue, and bone [ 2 , 5 , 12 ].\nChromium is excreted mainly in the urine [ 1 , 12 , 13 ]. Urinary chromium levels are therefore a good indicator of chromium absorption. However, because these levels are closely related to recent chromium intakes, they are not good indicators of chromium body stores [ 4 , 14 ]. Hair levels might reflect past chromium intakes [ 5 ], and some studies have measured chromium levels in hair, sweat, serum, and toenails [ 15 , 16 ]. However, no validated methods for determining chromium status and no clinically defined chromium deficiency state exist [ 6 , 8 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for chromium and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by an expert committee of the FNB at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [ 2 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nIn its 2001 evaluation, the FNB found the existing data insufficient to derive an EAR for chromium. The FNB therefore established AIs for all ages based on usual chromium intakes in healthy populations [ 2 ]. Table 1 lists the current AIs for chromium.\n",
    "Food": "Chromium is present in many foods, including meats, grain products, fruits, vegetables, nuts, spices, brewer’s yeast, beer, and wine. However, chromium amounts in these foods vary widely depending on local soil and water conditions as well as agricultural and manufacturing processes used to produce them [ 4 , 7 , 12 , 17-20 ]. For example, the amount of chromium can vary 50-fold in samples of oatmeal because of growing and processing differences [ 21 ]. Some chromium can also be transferred to foods from stainless steel equipment during food processing and from pots and pans during cooking [ 3 , 4 , 10 , 17 , 20 , 22 , 23 ].\nMost dairy products and foods high in sugar (e.g., sucrose and fructose) are low in chromium [ 2 , 17 , 24 ].\nHuman milk contains about 0.25 mcg/L chromium [ 2 ], but reported values vary widely. Small studies in Europe found chromium concentrations ranging from 0.14 to 10.8 mcg/L [ 5 ].\nDietary chromium absorption is low, ranging from about 0.4% to 2.5% [ 5 , 6 ]. Ascorbic acid and prostaglandin inhibitors, such as aspirin, increase chromium absorption, whereas oxalate and antacids inhibit it [ 1 , 22 , 25 ].\nA variety of types of foods and their chromium levels per serving are listed in Table 2. Determining the chromium content of food is challenging because samples are easily contaminated by standard tools used for measurement and analysis [ 2 ]. Therefore, the values in Table 2 should only serve as a guide.\n*DV = Daily Value. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for chromium is 35 mcg for adults and children age 4 and older [ 26 ]. FDA does not require food labels to list chromium content unless chromium has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet.\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "Most multivitamin/mineral supplements contain chromium, typically 35–120 mcg. Supplements containing only chromium are also available, and they commonly provide 200 mcg to 500 mcg chromium, although some contain up to 1,000 mcg [ 16 , 27 ].\nDietary supplements contain many forms of chromium, including chromium picolinate, chromium nicotinate, chromium polynicotinate, chromium chloride, and chromium histidinate [ 18 , 27 ]. The absorption of various forms of chromium is similar [ 6 , 9 ]. For example, research suggests that the proportion of chromium absorbed from chromium picolinate is about 1.2%, whereas that from chromium chloride is about 0.4% [ 1 ]. These values are similar to the proportion of chromium absorbed from food [ 5 ].\nChromium compounds contain various percentages of elemental chromium. For example, elemental chromium accounts for 12.4% of the weight of chromium picolinate [ 18 , 28 ]. The Supplement Facts label on a dietary supplement product declares the amount of elemental chromium, not the weight of the entire chromium compound, in the product.\n",

    "Metabolic syndrome": "Metabolic syndrome is a group of risk factors—abdominal obesity, high triglyceride level, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL; good) cholesterol level, hypertension, and high fasting blood glucose level—that raise the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and stroke [ 45 ]. Insulin resistance is an integral component of this condition and is a potential therapeutic target for dietary interventions for metabolic syndrome [ 46 ]. A prospective study of 3,648 adults age 20–32 years found that baseline toenail chromium concentrations were inversely associated with the incidence of metabolic syndrome over 23 years of follow-up [ 47 ]. For these reasons, some scientists have hypothesized that chromium supplements might benefit people with metabolic syndrome.\nOnly a few clinical trials of chromium supplementation for metabolic syndrome have been conducted [ 46 , 48-50 ]. One of these trials included 63 adults age 18 to 75 years with metabolic syndrome who received either 500 mcg chromium picolinate or placebo twice daily for 16 weeks [ 46 ]. In comparison with placebo, chromium supplementation significantly increased acute insulin response to glucose but did not affect HbA1c levels, insulin sensitivity, or other measures of glucose metabolism. Chromium supplementation also had no effect on body weight or serum lipids.\nSimilarly, in a 2018 clinical trial of 70 adults (mean age 58 years) with metabolic syndrome and impaired glucose tolerance, daily supplementation with 300 mcg chromium (200 mcg with breakfast and 100 mcg with dinner, as chromium yeast) for 24 weeks did not affect fasting glucose levels, HbA1c, waist circumference, blood pressure, or lipid levels [ 49 ].\nOverall, limited research suggests that chromium supplements do not significantly benefit people with metabolic syndrome.\n",

    "Chromium Intakes and Status": "The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) provides dietary intake data for many nutrients, but not chromium [ 29 ]. Therefore, data on chromium intakes in the United States are limited.\nA small study in eight men and 11 women in the United States found mean chromium intakes of about 29 mcg/day for women and 54 mcg/day for men [ 30 ]. In another study, the mean chromium content per 2,000 kcal of 22 well-balanced diets designed by nutritionists was about 27 mcg and ranged from about 17 to 47 mcg [ 17 ]. These findings suggest that most people in the United States have chromium intakes similar to the AIs. A 2018 dietary intake assessment in Northern Italy found that the median chromium intake was about 57 mcg/day from a typical Italian diet [ 31 ].\nData on chromium intakes from dietary supplements are also very limited. According to an analysis of NHANES III (1988–1994) data, the median supplemental intake of chromium was about 23 mcg/day among those taking supplements containing chromium [ 2 ].\n",
    "Chromium Deficiency": "Chromium deficiency has not been reported in healthy populations, and no definitive deficiency symptoms have been established [ 3 , 4 ].\nIn three case studies published in the 1970s and 1980s, patients on long-term total parenteral nutrition (TPN) experienced adverse metabolic and neurological effects, including hyperglycemia, glycosuria, unexplained weight loss, peripheral neuropathy, glucose intolerance, and/or confusion [ 32-34 ]. These effects were alleviated with pharmacologic amounts of chromium. Although these adverse effects were presumed to be caused by chromium deficiency, the studies did not adequately evaluate the chromium concentrations in the TPN solutions [ 5 ]. Scientists have concluded, based on recent evaluations, that these studies do not provide evidence that the patients had chromium deficiency and thus do not demonstrate that heathy people can develop chromium deficiency [ 3 , 5 , 6 , 10 , 13 ].\nCurrently, chromium is routinely added to TPN solutions to provide 10–15 mcg chromium per day, a much higher daily amount than the approximately 0.15 mcg/day that healthy individuals absorb from a balanced diet [ 9 ]. Thus, the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition and other experts recommend research on parenteral chromium requirements to determine whether chromium levels in TPN solutions should be lowered [ 9 , 13 , 35 , 36 ].\n",
    "Chromium and Health": "This section focuses on five conditions in which chromium might have beneficial effects: impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes, metabolic syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), dyslipidemia, and weight and lean body mass.\n",
    "Impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes": "Because chromium might potentiate the action of insulin, studies have examined whether increasing chromium intakes might reduce the risk of impaired glucose tolerance.\nNumerous randomized controlled trials have assessed the effects of chromium supplements–often at pharmacological doses (e.g., in the hundreds of mcg)–in people without diabetes or with glucose intolerance or diabetes [ 16 ]. One of the most commonly cited intervention studies of the effects of chromium supplementation for type 2 diabetes was a 1997 randomized controlled trial [ 37 ]. The trial assigned 180 adults age 35–65 years with type 2 diabetes to receive 100 mcg chromium (as chromium picolinate), 500 mcg chromium, or placebo twice daily for 4 months. At both 2 and 4 months, participants receiving 1,000 mcg/day chromium had significantly lower fasting serum glucose concentrations than those receiving placebo or 200 mcg/day chromium. At 4 months, for example, mean fasting serum glucose levels were 7.1 mmol/L (128 mg/dL) in the group receiving 1,000 mcg/day chromium and 8.8 mmol/L (159 mg/dL) in those receiving placebo. Mean serum glucose concentrations after a 75 g glucose challenge were also significantly lower at both 2 and 4 months in those receiving 1,000 mcg/day chromium (10.5 mmol/L [189 mg/dL] at 4 months vs. 12.3 mmol/L [222 mg/dL] for placebo). In comparison with placebo, both 200 mcg and 1,000 mcg/day chromium also significantly reduced fasting insulin concentrations at both 2 and 4 months, as well as insulin concentrations after a glucose challenge. Finally, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels were significantly lower after 4 months in participants receiving 200 mcg/day chromium (mean 7.5%) or 1,000 mcg/day chromium (mean 6.6%) than in those receiving placebo (mean 8.5%). HbA1c is a robust measure of blood glucose control because it reflects long-term changes in blood glucose levels [ 38 ].\nSeveral subsequent studies that used various doses of chromium had inconsistent findings. A 2019 review of chromium and glycemic control included eight meta-analyses and systematic reviews of a total of 58 clinical trials [ 16 ]. The trials lasted from 3 weeks to 6 months and administered 1.28 to 1,000 mcg chromium daily. The most frequently used form was chromium picolinate, followed by yeasts containing chromium and chromium chloride. Overall, when used as an adjuvant treatment, chromium lowered fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c levels slightly in people with diabetes. However, the clinical significance of these findings is unclear. The authors of a 2016 review of chromium supplementation in people with type 2 diabetes drew similar conclusions, noting the insufficient rationale to recommend chromium supplements for people with type 2 diabetes and that chromium supplements do not help moderate glucose levels in healthy individuals [ 39 ].\nSome research suggests that responses to chromium supplementation may vary, and supplements might be more likely to benefit people with more severe insulin resistance and poorer glycemic control [ 18 , 40 ]. In a randomized trial in 137 participants age 30–70 years with type 2 diabetes, daily supplementation with 1,000 mcg chromium (as chromium picolinate) for 24 weeks did not significantly affect insulin sensitivity, fasting glucose levels, or HbA1c values in comparison with placebo [ 40 ]. However, some participants did respond to chromium supplementation, and these people had significantly lower insulin sensitivity (3.98 vs. 5.91 mg/kg fat-free mass/min) and higher fasting glucose (8.5 vs. 6.7 mmol/L [153 vs. 121 mg/dL]) and HbA1c levels (7.57 vs. 6.29%) than those who did not respond.\nManufacturers market chromium supplements widely in the United States for people with type 2 diabetes, and many adults use them in the hope that the supplements will reduce their risk of diabetes or improve their glycemic control [ 6 , 8 , 18 , 39 ]. However, FDA allows only the following qualified health claim for chromium picolinate dietary supplements:\n\nIn its 2010 diabetes guidelines, the American Diabetes Association concluded that because studies have not definitively shown that chromium supplementation benefits people with diabetes or obesity, the association cannot recommend such supplementation [ 43 ]. This determination was based on conflicting evidence from poorly controlled or uncontrolled studies. Similarly, the association concluded in its 2015 position statement that evidence is insufficient to support the routine use of supplements containing chromium and other micronutrients for glycemic control in people with diabetes [ 44 ]. Additional research is needed to determine whether specific populations (e.g., ethnic background, obesity status, baseline insulin sensitivity, and medication use) might be more likely than others to benefit from chromium supplementation [ 18 ].\n",
    "Polycystic ovary syndrome": "PCOS is a common endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age. It is characterized by infertility, obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperandrogenism, and elevated risks of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease [ 51 , 52 ]. Because insulin resistance is often a central component of PCOS, studies have investigated the use of chromium supplements in people with PCOS to help maintain glycemic control and reduce lipid levels [ 16 , 53 ].\nFour recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials have examined the effects of chromium supplements on signs and symptoms of PCOS [ 52 , 54-56 ]. One analysis included seven trials with a total of 351 participants that administered chromium (as chromium picolinate) at 200 mcg to 1,000 mcg daily for 8 to 24 weeks [ 52 ]. Chromium supplementation had no effect on fasting blood glucose, total testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, or luteinizing hormone levels. However, chromium did significantly reduce body mass index (BMI) by 2.37 kg/m 2 and free testosterone levels by 0.52 pg/mL in comparison with placebo; it also significantly reduced fasting insulin levels by 0.33 milli-IU/mL.\nAnother systematic review and meta-analysis of five randomized trials lasting 8 weeks to 6 months that included a total of 268 women with PCOS compared supplemental chromium (200−1,000 mcg/d, mostly as chromium picolinate) with placebo or metformin [ 55 ]. Chromium supplementation had no significant effect on fasting insulin levels or insulin sensitivity, but data from two trials showed that it did significantly lower a measure of insulin resistance. In addition, one trial included in the review found that chromium supplementation significantly improved a measure of beta-cell function. The authors concluded that the magnitude of chromium’s effect was small and of uncertain clinical relevance. Similarly, another meta-analysis and a systematic review had mixed findings [ 54 , 56 ].\nOverall, the evidence on whether chromium supplementation reduces the risk of PCOS or is beneficial for women with this condition is mixed, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions [ 16 ]. Additional studies with sufficient samples sizes and duration in well-defined populations are needed [ 53 ].\n",
    "Dyslipidemia": "Numerous studies show associations between poor chromium status and elevated blood cholesterol levels [ 7 ]. Therefore, scientists hypothesize that chromium supplementation might improve blood lipid levels. Studies have examined this possibility in various populations, including people with impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes, or PCOS.\nIn a randomized clinical trial in 71 participants (mean age 54.1 years) with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (HbA1c of at least 7%), supplementation with 600 mcg/day chromium picolinate for 4 months had no effect on total cholesterol, HDL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL; bad) cholesterol, or triglyceride levels in comparison with placebo [ 57 ]. However, an 8-week trial in 40 women with PCOS age 18–40 years found that 200 mcg/day chromium as chromium picolinate significantly decreased serum triglycerides in comparison with placebo (–19.2 vs. +8.3 mg/dL) and total cholesterol levels (–15.3 vs. –0.6 mg/dL) [ 58 ]. Results of studies with higher doses of supplemental chromium have also been mixed [ 37 , 59 ].\nOverall, meta-analyses examining the effects of chromium supplementation in people with diabetes [ 60-64 ] and PCOS [ 54 ] have shown no significant changes in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels [ 16 ]. However, some have shown that chromium supplementation increases HDL cholesterol levels by 1.73–4.64 mg/dL and decreases triglyceride levels by 11.71–26.57 mg/dL [ 63 , 64 ].\nAdditional research is needed to determine whether chromium supplementation has any clinically significant effects on dyslipidemia.\n",
    "Weight and lean body mass": "Because chromium might amplify insulin action, some scientists have proposed that chromium supplementation could reduce the amount of glucose converted to fat and increase protein synthesis and, hence, muscle mass [ 12 ]. Some preliminary research also indicates that chromium supplements might reduce food intakes, hunger levels, and fat cravings [ 65 ]. Therefore, chromium supplementation has been proposed to both enhance weight loss and improve body composition by decreasing body fat and increasing lean body mass; its effects on these outcomes have been evaluated in several clinical trials [ 12 , 66-69 ].\nA 2019 meta-analysis included 21 trials that measured the impact of chromium supplementation on anthropometric indexes in a total of 1,316 participants age 18 or older with overweight or obesity [ 70 ]. Trial durations ranged from 9 to 24 weeks, and chromium doses were 200 to 1,000 mcg per day. Most trials used chromium picolinate, and others used chromium-enriched yeast or chromium nicotinate. Participants taking chromium supplements lost significantly more weight, 0.75 kg, than those taking placebo and had a significant 0.40 kg/m 2 reduction in BMI and body fat percentage, 0.68%, in comparison with placebo. The chromium supplements had no significant effect on waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio.\nTwo other systematic reviews and meta-analyses had similar findings [ 71 , 72 ], as did a 2013 Cochrane Review [ 67 ]. The Cochrane Review’s authors noted that the effect of chromium supplementation on body weight is of “debatable clinical relevance” and the overall quality of the evidence is low.\nOverall, research suggests that supplementation with chromium, mainly in the form chromium picolinate, reduces body weight and body fat percentage to a very small, but statistically significant, extent. However, these effects have little clinical significance.\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Chromium": "The FNB concluded that no adverse effects have been linked to high intakes of chromium from food or supplements, so it did not establish a UL for chromium [ 2 ]. However, the FNB noted that caution may be warranted because the data are limited and that high intakes of chromium could have adverse effects [ 2 , 3 , 6 ]. The FNB also pointed out that people with renal and liver disease might be susceptible to adverse effects from high chromium intakes [ 2 ].\nAccording to isolated case reports, chromium supplements might cause weight loss, anemia, thrombocytopenia, liver dysfunction, renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, dermatitis, and hypoglycemia [ 73 , 74 ].\n",
    "Insulin": "Chromium might increase insulin sensitivity [ 58 , 75 , 76 ]. Taking chromium concomitantly with insulin could increase the risk of hypoglycemia [ 77 ].\n",
    "Metformin and other antidiabetes medications": "The results from some studies indicate that chromium supplementation might lower blood glucose levels [ 16 , 37 , 57 , 58 , 60 ]. Therefore, chromium supplements might have an additive effect with metformin or other antidiabetes medications and thus might increase the risk of hypoglycemia.\n",
    "Chromium and Healthful Diets": "The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ...

    "Table of Contents": "Introduction Recommended Intakes Sources of Copper Copper Intakes and Status Copper Deficiency Groups at Risk of Copper Inadequacy Copper and Health Health Risks from Excessive Copper Interactions with Copper Copper and Healthful Diets References Disclaimer\nThis is a fact sheet intended for health professionals.  For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet .\n",
    "Introduction": "Copper, an essential mineral, is naturally present in some foods and is available as a dietary supplement. It is a cofactor for several enzymes (known as cuproenzymes) involved in energy production, iron metabolism, neuropeptide activation, connective tissue synthesis, and neurotransmitter synthesis [ 1-3 ]. One abundant cuproenzyme is ceruloplasmin (CP), which plays a role in iron metabolism and carries more than 95% of the total copper in healthy human plasma [ 4 ]. Copper is also involved in many physiologic processes, such as angiogenesis; neurohormone homeostasis; and regulation of gene expression, brain development, pigmentation, and immune system functioning [ 1 ]. In addition, defense against oxidative damage depends mainly on the copper-containing superoxide dismutases [ 5 , 6 ].\nA wide variety of plant and animal foods contain copper, and the average human diet provides approximately 1,400 mcg/day for men and 1,100 mcg/day for women that is primarily absorbed in the upper small intestine [ 1 , 2 , 7-9 ]. Almost two-thirds of the body’s copper is located in the skeleton and muscle [ 1 , 3 ].\nOnly small amounts of copper are typically stored in the body, and the average adult has a total body content of 50–120 mg copper [ 1 , 2 ]. Most copper is excreted in bile, and a small amount is excreted in urine. Total fecal losses of copper of biliary origin and nonabsorbed dietary copper are about 1 mg/day [ 1 , 2 ]. Copper levels in the body are homeostatically maintained by copper absorption from the intestine and copper release by the liver into bile to provide protection from copper deficiency and toxicity [ 3 ].\nCopper status is not routinely assessed in clinical practice, and no biomarkers that accurately and reliably assess copper status have been identified [ 2 ]. Human studies typically measure copper and cuproenzyme activity in plasma and blood cells because individuals with known copper deficiency often have low blood levels of copper and CP [ 2 ]. However, plasma CP and copper levels can be influenced by other factors, such as estrogen status, pregnancy, infection, inflammation, and some cancers [ 2 ]. Normal serum concentrations are 10–25 mcmol/L (63.5–158.9 mcg/dL) for copper and 180–400 mg/L for CP [ 10 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for copper and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [ 3 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nTable 1 lists the current RDAs for copper [ 3 ]. For infants from birth to 12 months, the FNB established an AI for copper that is equivalent to the mean intake of copper in healthy, breastfed infants.\n",
    "Food": "The richest dietary copper sources include shellfish, seeds and nuts, organ meats, wheat-bran cereals, whole-grain products, and chocolate [ 1 , 2 ]. The absorption of copper is strongly influenced by the amount of copper in the diet; bioavailability ranges from 75% of dietary copper when the diet contains only 400 mcg/day to 12% when the diet contains 7.5 mg/day [ 3 ].\nTap water and other beverages can also be sources of copper, although the amount of copper in these liquids varies by source (ranging from 0.0005 mg/L to 1 mg/L) [ 2 , 11 ].\nSeveral food sources of copper are listed in Table 2.\n*DV = Daily Value. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for copper is 0.9 mg (900 mcg) for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 13 ]. FDA does not require food labels to list copper content unless copper has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) FoodData Central [ 12 ] lists the nutrient content of many foods.\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "Copper is available in dietary supplements containing only copper, in supplements containing copper in combination with other ingredients, and in many multivitamin/mineral products [ 14 ]. These supplements contain many different forms of copper, including cupric oxide, cupric sulfate, copper amino acid chelates, and copper gluconate. To date, no studies have compared the bioavailability of copper from these and other forms [ 15 ]. The amount of copper in dietary supplements typically ranges from a few micrograms to 15 mg (about 17 times the DV for copper) [ 14 ].\n",

    "Cardiovascular disease": "Copper deficiency leads to changes in blood lipid levels, a risk factor for atherosclerotic CVD [ 1 ]. Animal studies have shown that copper deficiency is associated with cardiac abnormalities, possibly because of the resulting decreases in the activity of several cardiac cuproenzymes [ 1 , 2 ].\nHowever, observational studies of the link between copper concentrations and CVD have had mixed results. A representative cohort study of 1,197 asymptomatic adults age 45 to 64 in Italy assessed the effects of self-reported copper intakes on various metabolic markers, including markers of atherosclerotic disease risk (diastolic blood pressure, total and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] levels) [ 24 ]. Diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol levels were significantly lower in the highest tertile of copper intake (2.29 mg/day) compared with the lowest tertile (1.12 mg/day). In contrast, an analysis of 1976–1992 data on 4,574 participants in the second NHANES found that the risk of death from coronary heart disease was 2.87 times higher for participants age 30 and older in the fourth quartile for serum copper concentration (137 mcg/dL or higher) than for those in the first quartile (less than 106 mcg/dL) [ 25 ]. Similarly, an analysis of data on 3,253 adults with acute coronary syndromes (mean age 62 years in the 70% who were male and 65 years in the 30% who were female) in a cardiovascular health study in Germany found higher hazard ratios—2.58 for copper and 3.02 for CP concentrations in serum—for death from CVD in the highest (mean 147 mcg/dL for copper, 38.3 mg/dL for CP) versus the lowest (81.6 mcg/dL for copper, 22.9 mg/dL for CP) quartiles [ 26 ].\nA few small studies that assessed the impact of copper supplementation in healthy adults have found little evidence that supplementation affects CVD risk factors. For example, daily supplementation with 2 mg copper as copper glycinate for 8 weeks in 70 healthy adults age 45 to 60 years increased the activity of two cuproenzymes, erythrocyte superoxide dismutase 1 and plasma CP, but had no effect on five other CVD-related plasma markers (CRP, homocysteine, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol) [ 27 ]. In 16 healthy women (mean age 24 years), daily supplementation with 3 mg or 6 mg elemental copper as copper sulfate had no significant effect on CVD risk factors, including total plasma cholesterol or triacylglycerol concentrations [ 28 ]. However, the concentration of fibrinolytic factor PAI-I decreased by about 30% (indicating reduced CVD risk) with 6 mg/day copper supplementation compared with placebo. No clinical trials of copper supplementation have been conducted in people with increased CVD risk.\nOverall, the evidence to date is insufficient to support any conclusions about the association between copper concentrations and CVD risk or the impact of copper supplementation on CVD.\n",

    "Copper Intakes and Status": "Typical diets in the United States meet or exceed the copper RDA. Mean dietary intakes of copper from foods range from 800 to 1,000 mcg per day for children age 2–19 [ 9 ]. In adults age 20 and older, average daily intakes of copper from food are 1,400 mcg for men and 1,100 mcg for women. Total intakes from supplements and foods are 900 to 1,100 mcg/day for children and 1,400 to 1,700 mcg/day for adults age 20 and over.\nAccording to an analysis of data from the 2009–2012 National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES), 6% to 15% of adults age 19 and older who do not take dietary supplements containing copper have copper intakes below the EAR [ 16 ]. In those who do use supplements, rates of adults with intakes below the copper EAR range from 2.2% to 7.2%.\n",
    "Copper Deficiency": "Copper deficiency is uncommon in humans [ 2 ]. Based on studies in animals and humans, the effects of copper deficiency include anemia, hypopigmentation, hypercholesterolemia, connective tissue disorders, osteoporosis and other bone defects, abnormal lipid metabolism, ataxia, and increased risk of infection [ 1 , 17 , 18 ].\n",
    "Groups at Risk of Copper Inadequacy": "The following groups are most likely to have inadequate copper status.\n",
    "People with celiac disease": "In a study of 200 adults and children with celiac disease, of which 69.9% claimed to maintain a gluten-free diet, 15% had copper deficiency (less than 70 mcg/dL in serum in men and girls younger than 12 years and less than 80 mcg/dL in women older than 12 years and/or CP less than 170 mg/L) as a result of intestinal malabsorption resulting from the intestinal lining alterations associated with celiac disease [ 19 ]. In its 2009 clinical guidelines for celiac disease, the American College of Gastroenterology notes that people with celiac disease appear to have an increased risk of copper deficiency and that copper levels normalize within a month of adequate copper supplementation while eating a gluten-free diet [ 20 ].\n",
    "People with Menkes disease": "Menkes disease is a rare, X-linked, recessive disorder of copper homeostasis caused by ATP7A mutations, which encode a copper-transporting ATPase [ 1 ]. In these individuals, intestinal absorption of dietary copper drops sharply, leading to signs of copper deficiency, including low serum copper and CP levels [ 1 , 21 ]. The typical manifestations of Menkes disease include failure to thrive, impaired cognitive development, aortic aneurysms, seizures, and unusually kinky hair [ 22 ]. Most individuals with Menkes disease die by age 3 years if untreated, but subcutaneous injections of copper starting in the first few weeks after birth can reduce mortality risk and improve development [ 23 ].\n",
    "People taking high doses of zinc supplements": "High dietary intakes of zinc can interfere with copper absorption, and excessive use of zinc supplements can lead to copper deficiency. Reductions in erythrocyte copper-zinc superoxide dismutase, a marker of copper status, have been reported with even moderately high zinc intakes of approximately 60 mg/day for up to 10 weeks [ 3 ]. People who regularly consume high doses of zinc from supplements or use excessive amounts of zinc-containing denture creams can develop copper deficiency because zinc can inhibit copper absorption. This is one reason the FNB established the UL for zinc at 40 mg/day for adults [ 1 , 3 ].\n",
    "Copper and Health": "This section focuses on two diseases in which copper might play a role: cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer’s disease.\n",
    "Alzheimer’s disease": "Some experts believe that dietary copper deficiency plays a role in the etiology and pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease, the leading cause of dementia, because of several reports of low copper levels and low activity of copper-dependent enzymes in the brains of people with the disease [ 7 , 29 ]. Limited evidence shows that people with higher copper levels have a lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease [ 30 ]. However, high levels of copper have also been found in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease, and some researchers argue that excess amounts of dietary copper are involved in the development of this disease [ 31 ]. Furthermore, copper accumulation in damaged brain regions in Alzheimer’s disease might not directly reflect overall body copper status or copper intakes [ 32 ].\nA few observational studies have assessed the relationship between dietary copper levels and Alzheimer’s disease, with mixed results. One study, for example, assessed cognitive function using four cognitive tests during home visits every 3 years for 6 years and intakes of copper and saturated and trans fats using a food frequency questionnaire in 3,718 community-dwelling (noninstitutionalized) adults age 65 and older [ 33 ]. In the overall study population, dietary and total copper intakes were not associated with cognitive decline. However, in 604 participants (16.2%) who consumed a diet higher in saturated and trans fat, total copper intake in the highest quintile (median 2.75 mg/day) was associated with a significantly faster rate of cognitive decline compared with the lowest intake quintile (median 0.88 mg/day). In contrast, an analysis of data on 1,112 adults older than 60 years found no differences in serum copper or CP levels between patients with Alzheimer’s disease (n=211) and healthy controls (n=695) [ 32 ]. This study did reveal, however, a significant decline in serum copper not bound to CP in patients with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease compared with the healthy control group 18 months after baseline.\nMeta-analyses have found that people with Alzheimer’s disease tend to have higher serum copper levels than adults without the disease. In a meta-analysis of 10 studies in 867 healthy individuals and 599 with Alzheimer’s disease (mean age greater than 70 years in both groups), patients with Alzheimer’s disease had significantly higher serum levels of copper not bound to CP and total serum copper than healthy controls [ 34 ]. In an earlier meta-analysis of 26 studies in a total of 1,058 patients with Alzheimer’s disease and 932 controls, those with Alzheimer’s disease had significantly higher levels of serum copper than the healthy controls [ 35 ].\nVery little clinical evidence is available on the impact of copper supplementation in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. One clinical trial that randomly assigned 68 patients age 50 to 80 years with mild Alzheimer’s disease to supplementation with 8 mg copper daily or placebo for 12 months found no significant differences in cognition between groups [ 36 ].\nExperts participating in the 2013 International Conference on Nutrition and the Brain suggested that individuals at increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease using multivitamin/mineral supplements choose those that have no copper (or iron) because excessive intakes of these minerals could contribute to cognitive issues in some patients [ 37 ]. However, much more research is needed to determine whether high or low levels of serum or plasma copper are associated with Alzheimer’s disease risk and whether supplements containing copper could affect Alzheimer’s disease risk or symptoms.\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Copper": "Chronic exposure to high levels of copper can result in liver damage and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., abdominal pain, cramps, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting) [ 10 , 38 ]. Copper toxicity is rare in healthy individuals who do not have a hereditary copper homeostasis defect. However, copper toxicity has been reported in people who consume water containing high levels of copper as a result of stagnant water in copper-containing pipes and fixtures as well as copper alloys in water distribution systems and household plumbing that allow copper to leach into water [ 10 , 38 ]. The Environmental Protection Agency has established a recommended upper limit for copper in public water systems of 1.3 mg/L [ 38 , 39 ].\nPeople with Wilson’s disease, a rare, autosomal recessive disease, have a high risk of copper toxicity. Wilson’s disease, which is caused by a mutation in ATP7B , leads to abnormally high tissue levels of copper as a result of defective copper clearance [ 40 ]. People with this disease can develop neurologic and liver damage that can result in cirrhosis [ 1 ]. Patients can also develop acute hepatitis, hemolytic crisis, and liver failure. Lifelong copper chelation therapy or high doses of zinc can prevent permanent organ damage in these patients.\nThe FNB has established ULs for copper from food and supplements for healthy individuals based on levels associated with liver damage [ 10 ]. The ULs do not apply to individuals who are receiving supplemental copper under medical supervision.\n* Breast milk, formula, and food should be the only sources of copper for infants.\n",
    "Interactions with Copper": "Copper is not known to have any clinically relevant interactions with medications.\n",
    "Copper and Healthful Diets": "The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Some vegetables, fruits, grains, and dairy products contain copper. Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. Some organ meats, seafoods, and nuts and seeds are rich in copper, and other types of meats, fish, and beans contain copper. Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Limits alcoholic beverages. Stays within your daily calorie needs.\n",

    "Introduction": "Vitamin C, also known as L-ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in some foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. Humans, unlike most animals, are unable to synthesize vitamin C endogenously, so it is an essential dietary component [ 1 ].\nVitamin C is required for the biosynthesis of collagen, L-carnitine, and certain neurotransmitters; vitamin C is also involved in protein metabolism [ 1 , 2 ]. Collagen is an essential component of connective tissue, which plays a vital role in wound healing. Vitamin C is also an important physiological antioxidant [ 3 ] and has been shown to regenerate other antioxidants within the body, including alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) [ 4 ]. Ongoing research is examining whether vitamin C, by limiting the damaging effects of free radicals through its antioxidant activity, might help prevent or delay the development of certain cancers, cardiovascular disease, and other diseases in which oxidative stress plays a causal role. In addition to its biosynthetic and antioxidant functions, vitamin C plays an important role in immune function [ 4 ] and improves the absorption of nonheme iron [ 5 ], the form of iron present in plant-based foods. Insufficient vitamin C intake causes scurvy, which is characterized by fatigue or lassitude, widespread connective tissue weakness, and capillary fragility [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 6-9 ].\nThe intestinal absorption of vitamin C is regulated by at least one specific dose-dependent, active transporter [ 4 ]. Cells accumulate vitamin C via a second specific transport protein. In vitro studies have found that oxidized vitamin C, or dehydroascorbic acid, enters cells via some facilitated glucose transporters and is then reduced internally to ascorbic acid. The physiologic importance of dehydroascorbic acid uptake and its contribution to overall vitamin C economy are unknown.\nOral vitamin C produces tissue and plasma concentrations that the body tightly controls. Approximately 70%–90% of vitamin C is absorbed at moderate intakes of 30–180 mg/day. However, at doses above 1 g/day, absorption falls to less than 50% and absorbed, unmetabolized ascorbic acid is excreted in the urine [ 4 ]. Results from pharmacokinetic studies indicate that oral doses of 1.25 g/day ascorbic acid produce mean peak plasma vitamin C concentrations of 135 micromol/L, which are about two times higher than those produced by consuming 200–300 mg/day ascorbic acid from vitamin C-rich foods [ 10 ]. Pharmacokinetic modeling predicts that even doses as high as 3 g ascorbic acid taken every 4 hours would produce peak plasma concentrations of only 220 micromol/L [ 10 ].\nThe total body content of vitamin C ranges from 300 mg (at near scurvy) to about 2 g [ 4 ]. High levels of vitamin C (millimolar concentrations) are maintained in cells and tissues and are highest in leukocytes (white blood cells), eyes, adrenal glands, pituitary gland, and brain. Relatively low levels of vitamin C (micromolar concentrations) are found in extracellular fluids, such as plasma, red blood cells, and saliva [ 4 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for vitamin C and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academies (formerly National Academy of Sciences) [ 8 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and gender [ 8 ], include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nTable 1 lists the current RDAs for vitamin C [ 8 ]. The RDAs for vitamin C are based on its known physiological and antioxidant functions in white blood cells and are much higher than the amount required for protection from deficiency [ 4 , 8 , 11 ]. For infants from birth to 12 months, the FNB established an AI for vitamin C that is equivalent to the mean intake of vitamin C in healthy, breastfed infants.\n* Adequate Intake (AI)\n",
    "Food": "Fruits and vegetables are the best sources of vitamin C (see Table 2) [ 12 ]. Citrus fruits, tomatoes and tomato juice, and potatoes are major contributors of vitamin C to the American diet [ 8 ]. Other good food sources include red and green peppers, kiwifruit, broccoli, strawberries, Brussels sprouts, and cantaloupe (see Table 2) [ 8 , 12 ]. Although vitamin C is not naturally present in grains, it is added to some fortified breakfast cereals. The vitamin C content of food may be reduced by prolonged storage and by cooking because ascorbic acid is water soluble and is destroyed by heat [ 6 , 8 ]. Steaming or microwaving may lessen cooking losses. Fortunately, many of the best food sources of vitamin C, such as fruits and vegetables, are usually consumed raw. Consuming five varied servings of fruits and vegetables a day can provide more than 200 mg of vitamin C.\n*DV = Daily Value. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for vitamin C is 90 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 13 ]. FDA does not require food labels to list vitamin C content unless vitamin C has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) FoodData Central lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing vitamin C arranged by nutrient content and by food name .\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "Supplements typically contain vitamin C in the form of ascorbic acid, which has equivalent bioavailability to that of naturally occurring ascorbic acid in foods, such as orange juice and broccoli [ 14-16 ]. Other forms of vitamin C supplements include sodium ascorbate; calcium ascorbate; other mineral ascorbates; ascorbic acid with bioflavonoids; and combination products, such as Ester-C, which contains calcium ascorbate, dehydroascorbate, calcium threonate, xylonate and lyxonate [ 17 ].\nA few studies in humans have examined whether bioavailability differs among the various forms of vitamin C. In one study, Ester-C and ascorbic acid produced the same vitamin C plasma concentrations, but Ester-C produced significantly higher vitamin C concentrations in leukocytes 24 hours after ingestion [ 18 ]. Another study found no differences in plasma vitamin C levels or urinary excretion of vitamin C among three different vitamin C sources: ascorbic acid, Ester-C, and ascorbic acid with bioflavonoids [ 17 ]. These findings, coupled with the relatively low cost of ascorbic acid, led the authors to conclude that simple ascorbic acid is the preferred source of supplemental vitamin C [ 17 ].\n",

    "Cardiovascular disease": "Evidence from many epidemiological studies suggests that high intakes of fruits and vegetables are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease [ 1 , 55 , 56 ]. This association might be partly attributable to the antioxidant content of these foods because oxidative damage, including oxidative modification of low-density lipoproteins, is a major cause of cardiovascular disease [ 1 , 4 , 56 ]. In addition to its antioxidant properties, vitamin C has been shown to reduce monocyte adherence to the endothelium, improve endothelium-dependent nitric oxide production and vasodilation, and reduce vascular smooth-muscle-cell apoptosis, which prevents plaque instability in atherosclerosis [ 2 , 57 ].\nResults from prospective studies examining associations between vitamin C intake and cardiovascular disease risk are conflicting [ 56 ]. In the Nurses' Health Study, a 16-year prospective study involving 85,118 female nurses, total intake of vitamin C from both dietary and supplemental sources was inversely associated with coronary heart disease risk [ 58 ]. However, intake of vitamin C from diet alone showed no significant associations, suggesting that vitamin C supplement users might be at lower risk of coronary heart disease. A much smaller study indicated that postmenopausal women with diabetes who took at least 300 mg/day vitamin C supplements had increased cardiovascular disease mortality [ 59 ].\nA prospective study in 20,649 British adults found that those in the top quartile of baseline plasma vitamin C concentrations had a 42% lower risk of stroke than those in the bottom quartile [ 60 ]. In male physicians participating in the Physicians' Health Study, use of vitamin C supplements for a mean of 5.5 years was not associated with a significant decrease in total cardiovascular disease mortality or coronary heart disease mortality [ 61 ]. A pooled analysis of nine prospective studies that included 293,172 subjects free of coronary heart disease at baseline found that people who took ≥700 mg/day of supplemental vitamin C had a 25% lower risk of coronary heart disease incidence than those who took no supplemental vitamin C [ 62 ]. The authors of a 2008 meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies, including 14 studies reporting on vitamin C for a median follow-up of 10 years, concluded that dietary, but not supplemental, intake of vitamin C is inversely associated with coronary heart disease risk [ 55 ].\nResults from most clinical intervention trials have failed to show a beneficial effect of vitamin C supplementation on the primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. In the Women's Antioxidant Cardiovascular Study, a secondary prevention trial involving 8,171 women age 40 years or older with a history of cardiovascular disease, supplementation with 500 mg/day vitamin C for a mean of 9.4 years showed no overall effect on cardiovascular events [ 63 ]. Similarly, vitamin C supplementation (500 mg/day) for a mean follow-up of 8 years had no effect on major cardiovascular events in male physicians enrolled in the Physicians' Health Study II [ 64 ].\nOther clinical trials have generally examined the effects on cardiovascular disease of supplements combining vitamin C with other antioxidants, such as vitamin E and beta-carotene, making it more difficult to isolate the potential contribution of vitamin C. The SU.VI.MAX study examined the effects of a combination of vitamin C (120 mg/day), vitamin E (30 mg/day), beta-carotene (6 mg/day), selenium (100 mcg/day), and zinc (20 mg/day) in 13,017 French adults from the general population [ 33 ]. After a median follow-up time of 7.5 years, the combined supplements had no effect on ischemic cardiovascular disease in either men or women. In the Women's Angiographic Vitamin and Estrogen study, involving 423 postmenopausal women with at least one coronary stenosis of 15%–75%, supplements of 500 mg vitamin C plus 400 IU vitamin E twice per day not only provided no cardiovascular benefit, but significantly increased all-cause mortality compared with placebo [ 65 ].\nThe authors of a 2006 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that antioxidant supplements (vitamins C and E and beta-carotene or selenium) do not affect the progression of atherosclerosis [ 66 ]. Similarly, a systematic review of vitamin C's effects on the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease found that vitamin C did not have favorable effects on cardiovascular disease prevention [ 67 ]. Since then, researchers have published follow-up data from the Linxian trial, a population nutrition intervention trial conducted in China [ 38 ]. In this trial, daily vitamin C supplements (120 mg) plus molybdenum (30 mcg) for 5–6 years significantly reduced the risk of cerebrovascular deaths by 8% during 10 years of follow-up after the end of the active intervention.\nAlthough the Linxian trial data suggest a possible benefit, overall, the findings from most intervention trials do not provide convincing evidence that vitamin C supplements provide protection against cardiovascular disease or reduce its morbidity or mortality. However, as discussed in the cancer prevention section, clinical trial data for vitamin C are limited by the fact that plasma and tissue concentrations of vitamin C are tightly controlled in humans. If subjects' vitamin C levels were already close to saturation at study entry, supplementation would be expected to have made little or no difference on measured outcomes [ 22 , 23 , 41 , 42 ].\n",

    "Vitamin C Intakes and Status": "According to the 2001–2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), mean intakes of vitamin C are 105.2 mg/day for adult males and 83.6 mg/day for adult females, meeting the currently established RDA for most nonsmoking adults [ 19 ]. Mean intakes for children and adolescents age 1–18 years range from 75.6 mg/day to 100 mg/day, also meeting the RDA for these age groups [ 19 ]. Although the 2001–2002 NHANES analysis did not include data for breastfed infants and toddlers, breastmilk is considered an adequate source of vitamin C [ 8 , 14 ]. Use of vitamin C-containing supplements is also relatively common, adding to the total vitamin C intake from food and beverages. NHANES data from 1999–2000 indicate that approximately 35% of adults take multivitamin supplements (which typically contain vitamin C) and 12% take a separate vitamin C supplement [ 20 ]. According to 1999–2002 NHANES data, approximately 29% of children take some form of dietary supplement that contains vitamin C [ 21 ].\nVitamin C status is typically assessed by measuring plasma vitamin C levels [ 4 , 14 ]. Other measures, such as leukocyte vitamin C concentration, could be more accurate indicators of tissue vitamin C levels, but they are more difficult to assess and the results are not always reliable [ 4 , 9 , 14 ].\n",
    "Vitamin C Deficiency": "Acute vitamin C deficiency leads to scurvy [ 7 , 8 , 11 ]. The timeline for the development of scurvy varies, depending on vitamin C body stores, but signs can appear within 1 month of little or no vitamin C intake (below 10 mg/day) [ 6 , 7 , 22 , 23 ]. Initial symptoms can include fatigue (probably the result of impaired carnitine biosynthesis), malaise, and inflammation of the gums [ 4 , 11 ]. As vitamin C deficiency progresses, collagen synthesis becomes impaired and connective tissues become weakened, causing petechiae, ecchymoses, purpura, joint pain, poor wound healing, hyperkeratosis, and corkscrew hairs [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 6-8 ]. Additional signs of scurvy include depression as well as swollen, bleeding gums and loosening or loss of teeth due to tissue and capillary fragility [ 6 , 8 , 9 ]. Iron deficiency anemia can also occur due to increased bleeding and decreased nonheme iron absorption secondary to low vitamin C intake [ 6 , 11 ]. In children, bone disease can be present [ 6 ]. Left untreated, scurvy is fatal [ 6 , 9 ].\nUntil the end of the 18 th century, many sailors who ventured on long ocean voyages, with little or no vitamin C intake, contracted or died from scurvy. During the mid-1700s, Sir James Lind, a British Navy surgeon, conducted experiments and determined that eating citrus fruits or juices could cure scurvy, although scientists did not prove that ascorbic acid was the active component until 1932 [ 24-26 ].\nToday, vitamin C deficiency and scurvy are rare in developed countries [ 8 ]. Overt deficiency symptoms occur only if vitamin C intake falls below approximately 10 mg/day for many weeks [ 5-8 , 22 , 23 ]. Vitamin C deficiency is uncommon in developed countries but can still occur in people with limited food variety.\n",
    "Groups at Risk of Vitamin C Inadequacy": "Vitamin C inadequacy can occur with intakes that fall below the RDA but are above the amount required to prevent overt deficiency (approximately 10 mg/day). The following groups are more likely than others to be at risk of obtaining insufficient amounts of vitamin C.\n",
    "Smokers and passive smokers": "Studies consistently show that smokers have lower plasma and leukocyte vitamin C levels than nonsmokers, due in part to increased oxidative stress [ 8 ]. For this reason, the IOM concluded that smokers need 35 mg more vitamin C per day than nonsmokers [ 8 ]. Exposure to secondhand smoke also decreases vitamin C levels. Although the IOM was unable to establish a specific vitamin C requirement for nonsmokers who are regularly exposed to secondhand smoke, these individuals should ensure that they meet the RDA for vitamin C [ 4 , 8 ].\n",
    "Infants fed evaporated or boiled milk": "Most infants in developed countries are fed breastmilk and/or infant formula, both of which supply adequate amounts of vitamin C [ 8 , 14 ]. For many reasons, feeding infants evaporated or boiled cow's milk is not recommended. This practice can cause vitamin C deficiency because cow's milk naturally has very little vitamin C and heat can destroy vitamin C [ 6 , 12 ].\n",
    "Individuals with limited food variety": "Although fruits and vegetables are the best sources of vitamin C, many other foods have small amounts of this nutrient. Thus, through a varied diet, most people should be able to meet the vitamin C RDA or at least obtain enough to prevent scurvy. People who have limited food variety—including some elderly, indigent individuals who prepare their own food; people who abuse alcohol or drugs; food faddists; people with mental illness; and, occasionally, children—might not obtain sufficient vitamin C [ 4 , 6-9 , 11 ].\n",
    "People with malabsorption and certain chronic diseases": "Some medical conditions can reduce the absorption of vitamin C and/or increase the amount needed by the body. People with severe intestinal malabsorption or cachexia and some cancer patients might be at increased risk of vitamin C inadequacy [ 27 ]. Low vitamin C concentrations can also occur in patients with end-stage renal disease on chronic hemodialysis [ 28 ].\n",
    "Vitamin C and Health": "Due to its function as an antioxidant and its role in immune function, vitamin C has been promoted as a means to help prevent and/or treat numerous health conditions. This section focuses on the following four diseases and disorders in which vitamin C might play a role: cancer (including prevention and treatment), cardiovascular disease, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts, and the common cold.\n",
    "Cancer prevention": "Epidemiologic evidence suggests that higher consumption of fruits and vegetables is associated with lower risk of most types of cancer, perhaps, in part, due to their high vitamin C content [ 1 , 2 ]. Vitamin C can limit the formation of carcinogens, such as nitrosamines [ 2 , 29 ], in vivo; modulate immune response [ 2 , 4 ]; and, through its antioxidant function, possibly attenuate oxidative damage that can lead to cancer [ 1 ].\nMost case-control studies have found an inverse association between dietary vitamin C intake and cancers of the lung, breast, colon or rectum, stomach, oral cavity, larynx or pharynx, and esophagus [ 2 , 4 ]. Plasma concentrations of vitamin C are also lower in people with cancer than controls [ 2 ].\nHowever, evidence from prospective cohort studies is inconsistent, possibly due to varying intakes of vitamin C among studies. In a cohort of 82,234 women age 33–60 years from the Nurses' Health Study, consumption of an average of 205 mg/day of vitamin C from food (highest quintile of intake) compared with an average of 70 mg/day (lowest quintile of intake) was associated with a 63% lower risk of breast cancer among premenopausal women with a family history of breast cancer [ 30 ]. Conversely, Kushi and colleagues did not observe a significantly lower risk of breast cancer among postmenopausal women consuming at least 198 mg/day (highest quintile of intake) of vitamin C from food compared with those consuming less than 87 mg/day (lowest quintile of intake) [ 31 ]. A review by Carr and Frei concluded that in the majority of prospective cohort studies not reporting a significantly lower cancer risk, most participants had relatively high vitamin C intakes, with intakes higher than 86 mg/day in the lowest quintiles [ 2 ]. Studies reporting significantly lower cancer risk found these associations in individuals with vitamin C intakes of at least 80–110 mg/day, a range associated with close to vitamin C tissue saturation [ 2 , 22 , 32 ].\nEvidence from most randomized clinical trials suggests that vitamin C supplementation, usually in combination with other micronutrients, does not affect cancer risk. In the Supplémentation en Vitamines et Minéraux Antioxydants (SU.VI.MAX) study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial,13,017 healthy French adults received antioxidant supplementation with 120 mg ascorbic acid, 30 mg vitamin E, 6 mg beta-carotene, 100 mcg selenium, and 20 mg zinc, or placebo [ 33 ]. After a median follow-up time of 7.5 years, antioxidant supplementation lowered total cancer incidence in men but not in women. In addition, baseline antioxidant status was related to cancer risk in men but not in women [ 34 ]. Supplements of 500 mg/day vitamin C plus 400 International Units (IU) vitamin E every other day for a mean follow-up period of 8 years failed to reduce the risk of prostate or total cancer compared with placebo in middle-aged and older men participating in the Physicians' Health Study II [ 35 ]. Similar findings were reported in women participating in the Women's Antioxidant Cardiovascular Study [ 36 ]. Compared with placebo, supplementation with vitamin C (500 mg/day) for an average of 9.4 years had no significant effect on total cancer incidence or cancer mortality. In a large intervention trial conducted in Linxian, China, daily supplements of vitamin C (120 mg) plus molybdenum (30 mcg) for 5–6 years did not significantly affect the risk of developing esophageal or gastric cancer [ 37 ]. Moreover, during 10 years of follow-up, this supplementation regimen failed to significantly affect total morbidity or mortality from esophageal, gastric, or other cancers [ 38 ]. A 2008 review of vitamin C and other antioxidant supplements for the prevention of gastrointestinal cancers found no convincing evidence that vitamin C (or beta-carotene, vitamin A, or vitamin E) prevents gastrointestinal cancers [ 39 ]. A similar review by Coulter and colleagues found that vitamin C supplementation, in combination with vitamin E, had no significant effect on death risk due to cancer in healthy individuals [ 40 ].\nAt this time, the evidence is inconsistent on whether dietary vitamin C intake affects cancer risk. Results from most clinical trials suggest that modest vitamin C supplementation alone or with other nutrients offers no benefit in the prevention of cancer.\nA substantial limitation in interpreting many of these studies is that investigators did not measure vitamin C concentrations before or after supplementation. Plasma and tissue concentrations of vitamin C are tightly controlled in humans. At daily intakes of 100 mg or higher, cells appear to be saturated and at intakes of at least 200 mg, plasma concentrations increase only marginally [ 2 , 10 , 22 , 31 , 37 ]. If subjects' vitamin C levels were already close to saturation at study entry, supplementation would be expected to have made little or no difference on measured outcomes [ 22 , 23 , 41 , 42 ].\n",
    "Cancer treatment": "During the 1970s, studies by Cameron, Campbell, and Pauling suggested that high-dose vitamin C has beneficial effects on quality of life and survival time in patients with terminal cancer [ 43 , 44 ]. However, some subsequent studies—including a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial by Moertel and colleagues at the Mayo Clinic [ 45 ]—did not support these findings. In the Moertel study, patients with advanced colorectal cancer who received 10 g/day vitamin C fared no better than those receiving a placebo. The authors of a 2003 review assessing the effects of vitamin C in patients with advanced cancer concluded that vitamin C confers no significant mortality benefit [ 40 ].\nEmerging research suggests that the route of vitamin C administration (intravenous [IV] vs. oral) could explain the conflicting findings [ 1 , 46 , 47 ]. Most intervention trials, including the one conducted by Moertel and colleagues, used only oral administration, whereas Cameron and colleagues used a combination of oral and IV administration. Oral administration of vitamin C, even of very large doses, can raise plasma vitamin C concentrations to a maximum of only 220 micromol/L, whereas IV administration can produce plasma concentrations as high as 26,000 micromol/L [ 47 , 48 ]. Concentrations of this magnitude are selectively cytotoxic to tumor cells in vitro [ 1 , 67 ]. Research in mice suggests that pharmacologic doses of IV vitamin C might show promise in treating otherwise difficult-to-treat tumors [ 49 ]. A high concentration of vitamin C may act as a pro-oxidant and generate hydrogen peroxide that has selective toxicity toward cancer cells [ 49-51 ]. Based on these findings and a few case reports of patients with advanced cancers who had remarkably long survival times following administration of high-dose IV vitamin C, some researchers support reassessment of the use of high-dose IV vitamin C as a drug to treat cancer [ 3 , 47 , 49 , 52 ].\nAs discussed below, it is uncertain whether supplemental vitamin C and other antioxidants might interact with chemotherapy and/or radiation [ 53 ]. Therefore, individuals undergoing these procedures should consult with their oncologist prior to taking vitamin C or other antioxidant supplements, especially in high doses [ 54 ].\n",
    "Age-related macular degeneration and cataracts": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts are two of the leading causes of vision loss in older individuals. Oxidative stress might contribute to the etiology of both conditions. Thus, researchers have hypothesized that vitamin C and other antioxidants play a role in the development and/or treatment of these diseases.\nA population-based cohort study in the Netherlands found that adults age 55 years or older who had high dietary intakes of vitamin C as well as beta-carotene, zinc, and vitamin E had a reduced risk of AMD [ 68 ]. However, most prospective studies do not support these findings [ 69 ]. The authors of a 2007 systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies and randomized clinical trials concluded that the current evidence does not support a role for vitamin C and other antioxidants, including antioxidant supplements, in the primary prevention of early AMD [ 70 ].\nAlthough research has not shown that antioxidants play a role in AMD development, some evidence suggests that they might help slow AMD progression [ 71 ]. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, evaluated the effect of high doses of selected antioxidants (500 mg vitamin C, 400 IU vitamin E, 15 mg beta-carotene, 80 mg zinc, and 2 mg copper) on the development of advanced AMD in 3,597 older individuals with varying degrees of AMD [ 72 ]. After an average follow-up period of 6.3 years, participants at high risk of developing advanced AMD (i.e., those with intermediate AMD or those with advanced AMD in one eye) who received the antioxidant supplements had a 28% lower risk of progression to advanced AMD than participants who received a placebo. A follow-up AREDS2 study confirmed the value of this and similar supplement formulations in reducing the progression of AMD over a median follow-up period of 5 years [ 73 ].\nHigh dietary intakes of vitamin C and higher plasma ascorbate concentrations have been associated with a lower risk of cataract formation in some studies [ 2 , 4 ]. In a 5-year prospective cohort study conducted in Japan, higher dietary vitamin C intake was associated with a reduced risk of developing cataracts in a cohort of more than 30,000 adults age 45–64 years [ 74 ]. Results from two case-control studies indicate that vitamin C intakes greater than 300 mg/day reduce the risk of cataract formation by 70%–75% [ 2 , 4 ]. Use of vitamin C supplements, on the other hand, was associated with a 25% higher risk of age-related cataract extraction among a cohort of 24,593 Swedish women age 49–83 years [ 75 ]. These findings applied to study participants who took relatively high-dose vitamin C supplements (approximately 1,000 mg/day) and not to those who took multivitamins containing substantially less vitamin C (approximately 60 mg/day).\nData from clinical trials are limited. In one study, Chinese adults who took daily supplements of 120 mg vitamin C plus 30 mcg molybdenum for 5 years did not have a significantly lower cataract risk [ 76 ]. However, adults age 65–74 years who received 180 mg vitamin C plus 30 mcg molybdenum combined with other nutrients in a multivitamin/mineral supplement had a 43% significantly lower risk of developing nuclear cataracts than those who received a placebo [ 76 ]. In the AREDS study, older individuals who received supplements of 500 mg vitamin C, 400 IU vitamin E, and 15 mg beta-carotene for an average of 6.3 years did not have a significantly lower risk of developing cataracts or of cataract progression than those who received a placebo [ 77 ]. The AREDS2 study, which also tested formulations containing 500 mg vitamin C, confirmed these findings [ 78 ].\nOverall, the currently available evidence does not indicate that vitamin C, taken alone or with other antioxidants, affects the risk of developing AMD, although some evidence indicates that the AREDS formulations might slow AMD progression in people at high risk of developing advanced AMD.\n",
    "The common cold": "In the 1970s Linus Pauling suggested that vitamin C could successfully treat and/or prevent the common cold [ 79 ]. Results of subsequent controlled studies have been inconsistent, resulting in confusion and controversy, although public interest in the subject remains high [ 80 , 81 ].\nA 2007 Cochrane Review examined placebo-controlled trials involving the use of at least 200 mg/day vitamin C taken either continuously as a prophylactic treatment or after the onset of cold symptoms [ 81 ]. Prophylactic use of vitamin C did not significantly reduce the risk of developing a cold in the general population. However, in trials involving marathon runners, skiers, and soldiers exposed to extreme physical exercise and/or cold environments, prophylactic use of vitamin C in doses ranging from 250 mg/day to 1 g/day reduced cold incidence by 50%. In the general population, use of prophylactic vitamin C modestly reduced cold duration by 8% in adults and 14% in children. When taken after the onset of cold symptoms, vitamin C did not affect cold duration or symptom severity.\nOverall, the evidence to date suggests that regular intakes of vitamin C at doses of at least 200 mg/day do not reduce the incidence of the common cold in the general population, but such intakes might be helpful in people exposed to extreme physical exercise or cold environments and those with marginal vitamin C status, such as the elderly and chronic smokers [ 81-83 ]. The use of vitamin C supplements might shorten the duration of the common cold and ameliorate symptom severity in the general population [ 80 , 83 ], possibly due to the antihistamine effect of high-dose vitamin C [ 84 ]. However, taking vitamin C after the onset of cold symptoms does not appear to be beneficial [ 81 ].\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Vitamin C": "Vitamin C has low toxicity and is not believed to cause serious adverse effects at high intakes [ 8 ]. The most common complaints are diarrhea, nausea, abdominal cramps, and other gastrointestinal disturbances due to the osmotic effect of unabsorbed vitamin C in the gastrointestinal tract [ 4 , 8 ].\nIn postmenopausal women with diabetes who participated in the Iowa Women's Health Study, supplemental (but not dietary) vitamin C intake (at least 300 mg/day) was significantly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease mortality [ 59 ]. The mechanism for this effect, if real, is not clear and this finding is from a subgroup of patients in an epidemiological study. No such association has been observed in any other epidemiological study, so the significance of this finding is uncertain. High vitamin C intakes also have the potential to increase urinary oxalate and uric acid excretion, which could contribute to the formation of kidney stones, especially in individuals with renal disorders [ 8 ]. However, studies evaluating the effects on urinary oxalate excretion of vitamin C intakes ranging from 30 mg to 10 g/day have had conflicting results, so it is not clear whether vitamin C actually plays a role in the development of kidney stones [ 8 , 85-87 ]. The best evidence that vitamin C contributes to kidney stone formation is in patients with pre-existing hyperoxaluria [ 23 ].\nDue to the enhancement of nonheme iron absorption by vitamin C, a theoretical concern is that high vitamin C intakes might cause excess iron absorption. In healthy individuals, this does not appear to be a concern [ 8 ]. However, in individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis, chronic consumption of high doses of vitamin C could exacerbate iron overload and result in tissue damage [ 4 , 8 ].\nUnder certain conditions, vitamin C can act as a pro-oxidant, potentially contributing to oxidative damage [ 8 ]. A few studies in vitro have suggested that by acting as a pro-oxidant, supplemental oral vitamin C could cause chromosomal and/or DNA damage and possibly contribute to the development of cancer [ 8 , 88 , 89 ]. However, other studies have not shown increased oxidative damage or increased cancer risk with high intakes of vitamin C [ 8 , 90 ].\nOther reported effects of high intakes of vitamin C include reduced vitamin B12 and copper levels, accelerated metabolism or excretion of ascorbic acid, erosion of dental enamel, and allergic responses [ 8 ]. However, at least some of these conclusions were a consequence of assay artifact, and additional studies have not confirmed these observations [ 8 ].\nThe FNB has established ULs for vitamin C that apply to both food and supplement intakes (Table 3) [ 8 ]. Long-term intakes of vitamin C above the UL may increase the risk of adverse health effects. The ULs do not apply to individuals receiving vitamin C for medical treatment, but such individuals should be under the care of a physician [ 8 ].\n*Formula and food should be the only sources of vitamin C for infants.\n",
    "Chemotherapy and radiation": "The safety and efficacy of the use of vitamin C and other antioxidants during cancer treatment is controversial [ 53 , 91 , 92 ]. Some data indicate that antioxidants might protect tumor cells from the action of radiation therapy and chemotherapeutic agents, such as cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, carmustine, busulfan, thiotepa, and doxorubicin [ 54 , 91 , 93 , 94 ]. At least some of these data have been criticized because of poor study design [ 52 ]. Other data suggest that antioxidants might protect normal tissues from chemotherapy- and radiation-induced damage [ 91 , 93 ] and/or enhance the effectiveness of conventional cancer treatment [ 95 ]. However, due to the physiologically tight control of vitamin C, it is unclear whether oral vitamin C supplements could alter vitamin C concentrations enough to produce the suggested effects. Individuals undergoing chemotherapy or radiation should consult with their oncologist prior to taking vitamin C or other antioxidant supplements, especially in high doses [ 54 ].\n",
    "3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins)": "Vitamin C, in combination with other antioxidants, may attenuate the increase in high-density lipoprotein levels resulting from combination niacin–simvastatin (Zocor) therapy [ 96 , 97 ]. It is not known whether this interaction occurs with other lipid-altering regimens [ 54 ]. Health care providers should monitor lipid levels in individuals taking both statins and antioxidant supplements [ 54 ].\n",
    "Vitamin C and Healthful Diets": "The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Fruits, particularly citrus fruits, fruit juices, and many vegetables are excellent sources of vitamin C. Some ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are fortified with vitamin C. Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Limits alcoholic beverages. Stays within your daily calorie needs.\nFruits, particularly citrus fruits, fruit juices, and many vegetables are excellent sources of vitamin C.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet .\nFor information on vitamin D and COVID-19, see Dietary Supplements in the Time of COVID-19 .\n",
    "Introduction": "Vitamin D (also referred to as calciferol) is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in a few foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. It is also produced endogenously when ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight strike the skin and trigger vitamin D synthesis.\nVitamin D obtained from sun exposure, foods, and supplements is biologically inert and must undergo two hydroxylations in the body for activation. The first hydroxylation, which occurs in the liver, converts vitamin D to 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], also known as calcidiol. The second hydroxylation occurs primarily in the kidney and forms the physiologically active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], also known as calcitriol [ 1 ].\nVitamin D promotes calcium absorption in the gut and maintains adequate serum calcium and phosphate concentrations to enable normal bone mineralization and to prevent hypocalcemic tetany (involuntary contraction of muscles, leading to cramps and spasms). It is also needed for bone growth and bone remodeling by osteoblasts and osteoclasts [ 1-3 ]. Without sufficient vitamin D, bones can become thin, brittle, or misshapen. Vitamin D sufficiency prevents rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Together with calcium, vitamin D also helps protect older adults from osteoporosis.\nVitamin D has other roles in the body, including reduction of inflammation as well as modulation of such processes as cell growth, neuromuscular and immune function, and glucose metabolism [ 1-3 ]. Many genes encoding proteins that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis are modulated in part by vitamin D. Many tissues have vitamin D receptors, and some convert 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D.\nIn foods and dietary supplements, vitamin D has two main forms, D 2 (ergocalciferol) and D 3 (cholecalciferol), that differ chemically only in their side-chain structures. Both forms are well absorbed in the small intestine. Absorption occurs by simple passive diffusion and by a mechanism that involves intestinal membrane carrier proteins [ 4 ]. The concurrent presence of fat in the gut enhances vitamin D absorption, but some vitamin D is absorbed even without dietary fat. Neither aging nor obesity alters vitamin D absorption from the gut [ 4 ].\nSerum concentration of 25(OH)D is currently the main indicator of vitamin D status. It reflects vitamin D produced endogenously and that obtained from foods and supplements [ 1 ]. In serum, 25(OH)D has a fairly long circulating half-life of 15 days [ 1 ]. Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D are reported in both nanomoles per liter (nmol/L) and nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). One nmol/L is equal to 0.4 ng/mL, and 1 ng/mL is equal to 2.5 nmol/L.\nAssessing vitamin D status by measuring serum 25(OH)D concentrations is complicated by the considerable variability of the available assays (the two most common ones involve antibodies or chromatography) used by laboratories that conduct the analyses [ 5 , 6 ]. As a result, a finding can be falsely low or falsely high, depending on the assay used and the laboratory. The international Vitamin D Standardization Program has developed procedures for standardizing the laboratory measurement of 25(OH)D to improve clinical and public health practice [ 5 , 7-10 ].\nIn contrast to 25(OH)D, circulating 1,25(OH)2D is generally not a good indicator of vitamin D status because it has a short half-life measured in hours, and serum levels are tightly regulated by parathyroid hormone, calcium, and phosphate [ 1 ]. Levels of 1,25(OH)2D do not typically decrease until vitamin D deficiency is severe [ 2 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for vitamin D and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by expert committees of NASEM [ 1 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nAn FNB committee established RDAs for vitamin D to indicate daily intakes sufficient to maintain bone health and normal calcium metabolism in healthy people. RDAs for vitamin D are listed in both micrograms (mcg) and International Units (IU); 1 mcg vitamin D is equal to 40 IU (Table 2). Even though sunlight is a major source of vitamin D for some people, the FNB based the vitamin D RDAs on the assumption that people receive minimal sun exposure [ 1 ]. For infants, the FNB committee developed AIs based on the amount of vitamin D that maintains serum 25(OH)D levels above 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) and supports bone development.\nMany other countries around the world and some professional societies have somewhat different guidelines for vitamin D intakes [ 15 ]. These differences are a result of an incomplete understanding of the biology and clinical implications of vitamin D, different purposes for the guidelines (e.g., for public health in a healthy population or for clinical practice), and/or the use in some guidelines of observational studies in addition to randomized clinical trials to establish recommendations [ 9 , 15 ]. For example, the United Kingdom Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition recommends intakes of 10 mcg (400 IU)/day for individuals age 4 years and older [ 16 ]. The Endocrine Society recommends routine vitamin D supplementation for children and teens age 1 to 18 years, people who are pregnant, adults with pre-diabetes, and adults age 75 years and older, but not for healthy adults age 19 to 74 [ 11 , 12 ]. The Endocrine Society does not recommend specific doses but notes that all individuals should adhere to the RDA.\n",
    "Food": "Few foods naturally contain vitamin D. The flesh of fatty fish (such as trout, salmon, tuna, and mackerel) and fish liver oils are among the best sources [ 17 , 1 ]. An animal’s diet affects the amount of vitamin D in its tissues. Beef liver, egg yolks, and cheese have small amounts of vitamin D, primarily in the form of vitamin D 3 and its metabolite 25(OH)D 3 . Mushrooms provide variable amounts of vitamin D 2 [ 17 ]. Some mushrooms available on the market have been treated with UV light to increase their levels of vitamin D 2 . In addition, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved UV-treated mushroom powder as a food additive for use as a source of vitamin D 2 in food products [ 18 ]. Very limited evidence suggests no substantial differences in the bioavailability of vitamin D from various foods [ 19 ].\nAnimal-based foods typically provide some vitamin D in the form of 25(OH)D in addition to vitamin D 3 . The impact of this form on vitamin D status is an emerging area of research. Studies show that 25(OH)D appears to be approximately five times more potent than the parent vitamin for raising serum 25(OH)D concentrations [ 17 , 20 , 21 ]. One study found that when the 25(OH)D content of beef, pork, chicken, turkey, and eggs is taken into account, the total amount of vitamin D in the food is 2 to 18 times higher than the amount in the parent vitamin alone, depending on the food [ 20 ].\nFortified foods provide most of the vitamin D in American diets [ 1 , 22 ]. For example, almost all of the U.S. milk supply is voluntarily fortified with about 3 mcg/cup (120 IU), usually in the form of vitamin D 3 [ 23 ]. In Canada, milk must be fortified with 0.88–1.0 mcg/100 mL (35–40 IU), and the required amount for margarine is at least 13.25 mcg/100 g (530 IU). Other dairy products made from milk, such as cheese and ice cream, are not usually fortified in the United States or Canada. Plant milk alternatives (such as beverages made from soy, almond, or oats) are often fortified with similar amounts of vitamin D to those in fortified cow's milk (about 3 mcg [120 IU]/cup); the Nutrition Facts label lists the actual amount [ 24 ]. Ready-to-eat breakfast cereals often contain added vitamin D, as do some brands of orange juice, yogurt, margarine, and other food products.\nThe United States mandates the fortification of infant formula with 1–2.5 mcg/100 kcal (40–100 IU) vitamin D; 1–2 mcg/100 kcal (40–80 IU) is the required amount in Canada [ 1 ].\nA variety of foods and their vitamin D levels per serving are listed in Table 3.\n* DV = Daily Value. The FDA developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for vitamin D is 20 mcg (800 IU) for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 26 ]. The labels must list vitamin D content in mcg per serving and have the option of also listing the amount in IUs in parentheses. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. ** Vitamin D is in the yolk.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) FoodData Central lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing vitamin D arranged by nutrient content and by food name . However, FoodData Central does not include the amounts of 25(OH)D in foods.\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "Dietary supplements can contain vitamins D 2 or D 3 . Vitamin D 2 is manufactured using UV irradiation of ergosterol in yeast, and vitamin D 3 is typically produced with irradiation of 7-dehydrocholesterol from lanolin obtained from the wool of sheep [ 13 , 31 ]. An animal-free version of vitamin D3 sourced from lichen is also available [ 32 ]. People who avoid all animal-sourced products can contact dietary supplement manufacturers to ask about their sourcing and processing techniques.\nBoth vitamins D 2 and D 3 raise serum 25(OH)D levels, and they seem to have equivalent ability to cure rickets [ 4 ]. In addition, most steps in the metabolism and actions of vitamins D 2 and D 3 are identical. However, most evidence indicates that vitamin D 3 increases serum 25(OH)D levels to a greater extent and maintains these higher levels longer than vitamin D 2 , even though both forms are well absorbed in the gut [ 33-36 ].\nSome studies have used dietary supplements containing the 25(OH)D 3 form of vitamin D. Per equivalent microgram dose, 25(OH)D 3 is three to five times as potent as vitamin D 3 [ 37 , 38 ]. However, no 25(OH)D 3 dietary supplements appear to be available to consumers on the U.S. market at this time [ 32 ].\n",

    "Cancer": "Laboratory and animal studies suggest that vitamin D might inhibit carcinogenesis and slow tumor progression by, for example, promoting cell differentiation and inhibiting metastasis. Vitamin D might also have anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, proapoptotic, and antiangiogenic effects [ 1 , 87 ]. Observational studies and clinical trials provide mixed evidence on whether vitamin D intakes or serum levels affect cancer incidence, progression, or mortality risk.\nSome observational studies show associations between low serum levels of 25(OH)D and increased risks of cancer incidence and death. In a meta-analysis of 16 prospective cohort studies in a total of 137,567 participants who had 8,345 diagnoses of cancer, 5,755 participants died from cancer [ 88 ]. A 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) increase in 25(OH)D levels was associated with an 11% reduction in total cancer incidence rates and, in women but not men, a 24% reduction in cancer mortality rates. A meta-analysis of prospective studies that evaluated the association between serum 25(OH)D levels and cancer incidence (8 studies) or cancer mortality (16 studies) found that cancer risk decreased by 7% and cancer mortality rates decreased by 2% with each 20 nmol/L (8 ng/mL) increase in serum 25(OH)D levels [ 89 ]. Importantly, not all observational studies found higher vitamin D status to be beneficial, and the studies varied considerably in study populations, baseline comorbidities, and measurement of vitamin D levels.\nClinical trial evidence provides some support for the observational findings. For example, three meta-analyses of clinical trial evidence found that vitamin D supplementation does not affect cancer incidence but does significantly reduce total cancer mortality rates by 12%–13% [ 90-92 ]. In the most recent meta-analysis, 10 randomized clinical trials (including the VITAL trial described below) that included 6,537 cancer cases provided 10 to 50 mcg (400 to 2,000 IU) vitamin D 3 daily (six trials) or 500 mcg (20,000 IU)/week to 12,500 mcg (500,000 IU)/year boluses of vitamin D 3 (four trials) [ 91 ]. The study reports included 3–10 years of follow-up data. The vitamin D supplements were associated with serum 25(OH)D levels of 54 to 135 nmol/L (21.6 to 54 ng/mL). Vitamin D supplementation reduced cancer mortality rates by 13%, and most of the benefit occurred with daily supplementation.\nThe VITAL clinical trial that investigated the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the primary prevention of cancer in the general population gave 50 mcg (2,000 IU)/day vitamin D 3 supplements with or without 1,000 mg/day marine omega-3 fatty acids or a placebo for a median of 5.3 years [ 93 ]. The study included 25,871 men age 50 years and older and women age 55 years and older who had no history of cancer, and most had adequate serum 25(OH)D levels at baseline. Rates of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer did not differ significantly between the vitamin D and placebo groups. However, normal-weight participants had greater reductions in cancer incidence and mortality rates than those with overweight or obesity.\nThe Women's Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trial randomized 36,282 postmenopausal women to receive 10 mcg (400 IU) vitamin D 3 plus 1,000 mg calcium daily or a placebo for a mean of 7 years [ 94 ]. Results showed no effect of supplemental vitamin D and calcium on cancer incidence or mortality during the 7-year trial. Similarly, the supplements did not affect cancer incidence over a long-term median follow-up of 22.3 years, but they did reduce cancer mortality by 7% over this period of time [ 95 ].\nA few studies have examined the effect of vitamin D supplementation on specific cancers. Below are brief descriptions of studies of vitamin D and its association with, or effect on, breast, colorectal, lung, pancreatic, and prostate cancers.\nSome observational studies support an inverse association between 25(OH)D levels and breast cancer risk and mortality, but others do not [ 96-99 ]. In the WHI clinical trial described above, vitamin D 3 and calcium supplements did not reduce breast cancer incidence, and 25(OH)D levels at the start of the study were not associated with breast cancer risk [ 100 ].\nIn a subsequent investigation for 4.9 years after the study's end, women who had taken the vitamin D and calcium supplements (many of whom continued to take them) had an 18% lower risk of in situ (noninvasive) breast cancer [ 101 ]. However, women with vitamin D intakes higher than 15 mcg (600 IU)/day at the start of the trial and who received the supplements experienced a 28% increased risk of invasive (but not in situ) breast cancer.\nA large case-control study included 5,706 individuals who developed colorectal cancer and whose 25(OH)D levels were assessed a median of 5.5 years from blood draw to cancer diagnosis and 7,105 matched controls [ 102 ]. The results showed an association between 25(OH)D levels lower than 30 nmol/L (12 ng/mL) and a 31% higher colorectal cancer risk. Levels of 75 to less than 87.5 nmol/L (30 to less than 35 ng/mL) and 87.5 to less than 100 nmol/L (35 to less than 40 ng/mL) were associated with a 19% and 27% lower risk, respectively. The association was substantially stronger in women.\nIn the WHI clinical trial described above, vitamin D 3 and calcium supplements had no effect on rates of colorectal cancer [ 103 ]. In a subsequent investigation for 4.9 years after the study's end, women who had taken the vitamin D and calcium supplements (many of whom continued to take them) still had the same colorectal cancer risk as those who received placebo [ 101 ].\nAnother study included 2,259 healthy individuals age 45 to 75 years who had had one or more serrated polyps (precursor lesions to colorectal cancer) that had been removed [ 104 ]. These participants were randomized to take 25 mcg (1,000 IU) vitamin D 3 , 1,200 mg calcium, both supplements, or a placebo daily for 3–5 years, followed by an additional 3–5 years of observation after participants stopped the treatment. Vitamin D alone did not significantly affect the development of new serrated polyps, but the combination of vitamin D with calcium increased the risk almost fourfold. The VITAL trial found no association between vitamin D supplementation and the risk of colorectal adenomas or serrated polyps [ 105 ].\nA study of cohorts that included 5,313 participants who developed lung cancer and 5,313 matched controls found no association between serum 25(OH)D levels and risk of subsequent lung cancer, even when the investigators analyzed the data by sex, age, race and ethnicity, and smoking status [ 106 ].\nOne study comparing 738 men who developed pancreatic cancer to 738 matched controls found no relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels and risk of pancreatic cancer [ 107 ]. Another study that compared 200 male smokers in Finland with pancreatic cancer to 400 matched controls found that participants in the highest quintile of 25(OH)D levels (more than 65.5 nmol/L [26.2 ng/mL]) had a threefold greater risk of developing pancreatic cancer over 16.7 years than those in the lowest quintile (less than 32 nmol/L [12.8 ng/mL]) [ 108 ]. An investigation that pooled data from 10 studies of cancer in 12,205 men and women found that concentrations of 25(OH)D greater than 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) but less than 100 nmol/L (40 ng/mL) did not reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer. However, the results did show an increased risk of pancreatic cancer with 25(OH)D levels of 100 nmol/L (40 ng/mL) or above [ 109 ].\nResearch to date provides mixed evidence on whether levels of 25(OH)D are associated with the development of prostate cancer. Several studies published in 2014 suggested that high levels of 25(OH)D might increase the risk of prostate cancer. For example, a meta-analysis of 21 studies that included 11,941 men with prostate cancer and 13,870 controls found a 17% higher risk of prostate cancer for participants with higher levels of 25(OH)D [ 110 ]. What constituted a higher level varied by study but was typically at least 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL). In a cohort of 4,733 men, of which 1,731 had prostate cancer, those with 25(OH)D levels of 45–70 nmol/L (18–28 ng/mL) had a significantly lower risk of the disease than men with either lower or higher values [ 111 ]. This U-shaped association was most pronounced for men with the most aggressive forms of prostate cancer. A case-control analysis of 1,695 cases of prostate cancer and 1,682 controls found no associations between 25(OH)D levels and prostate cancer risk [ 112 ]. However, higher serum 25(OH)D levels (at a cut point of 75 nmol/L [30 ng/mL]) were linked to a modestly higher risk of slow-growth prostate cancer and a more substantial lower risk of aggressive disease.\nSince 2014, however, several published studies and meta-analyses have found no relationship between 25(OH)D levels and prostate cancer risk [ 113 , 114 ]. For example, an analysis was conducted of 19 prospective studies that provided data on prediagnostic levels of 25(OH)D for 13,462 men who developed prostate cancer and 20,261 control participants [ 115 ]. Vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency did not increase the risk of prostate cancer, and higher 25(OH)D concentrations were not associated with a lower risk.\nSeveral studies have examined whether levels of 25(OH)D in men with prostate cancer are associated with a lower risk of death from the disease or from any cause. One study included 1,119 men treated for prostate cancer whose plasma 25(OH)D levels were measured 4.9 to 8.6 years after their diagnosis. Among the 198 participants who died (41 deaths were due to prostate cancer), 25(OH)D levels were not associated with risk of death from prostate cancer or any cause [ 116 ]. However, a meta-analysis of seven cohort studies that included 7,808 men with prostate cancer found higher 25(OH)D levels to be significantly associated with lower mortality rates from prostate cancer or any other cause [ 117 ]. A dose-response analysis found that each 20 nmol/L [8 ng/mL] increase in 25(OH)D was associated with a 9% lower risk of both all-cause and prostate cancer-specific mortality.\nFor men with prostate cancer, whether vitamin D supplementation lengthens cancer-related survival is not clear. A meta-analysis of three randomized controlled trials in 1,273 men with prostate cancer found no significant differences in total mortality rates between those receiving vitamin D supplementation (from 10 mcg [400 IU]/day for 28 days to 45 mcg [1,800 IU] given in three doses total at 2-week intervals) and those receiving a placebo [ 118 ].\nThe USPSTF stated that, due to insufficient evidence, it was unable to assess the balance of benefits and harms of supplemental vitamin D to prevent cancer [ 119 ]. Taken together, studies to date do not indicate that vitamin D with or without calcium supplementation reduces the incidence of cancer, but adequate or higher 25(OH)D levels might reduce cancer mortality rates. Further research is needed to determine whether vitamin D inadequacy increases cancer risk, whether greater exposure to the nutrient can prevent cancer, and whether some individuals could have an increased risk of cancer because of their vitamin D status over time.\n",

    "Cardiovascular disease": "Vitamin D helps regulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (and thereby blood pressure), vascular cell growth, and inflammatory and fibrotic pathways [ 120 ]. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with vascular dysfunction, arterial stiffening, left ventricular hypertrophy, and hyperlipidemia [ 121 ]. For these reasons, vitamin D has been linked to heart health and risk of CVD.\nObservational studies support an association between higher serum 25(OH)D levels and a lower risk of CVD incidence and mortality. For example, a meta-analysis included 34 observational studies that followed 180,667 participants (mean age greater than 50 years) for 1.3 to more than 32 years. The results showed that baseline serum 25(OH)D levels were inversely associated with total number of CVD events (including myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and stroke) and mortality risk [ 122 ]. Overall, the risk of CVD events was 10% lower for each 25 nmol/L (10 ng/mL) increase in serum 25(OH)D.\nAnother large observational study that followed 247,574 adults from Denmark for 0–7 years found that levels of 25(OH)D that were low (about 12.5 nmol/L [5 ng/mL]) and high (about 125 nmol/L [50 ng/mL]) were associated with a greater risk of mortality from CVD, stroke, and acute myocardial infarction [ 123 ]. Other meta-analyses of prospective studies have found associations between lower vitamin D status measured by serum 25(OH)D levels or vitamin D intakes and an increased risk of ischemic stroke, ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, and early death [ 124 , 125 ].\nIn contrast to the observational studies, clinical trials have provided little support for the hypothesis that supplemental vitamin D reduces the risk of CVD or CVD mortality. For example, a 3-year trial in New Zealand randomized 5,110 adults (mean age 65.9 years) to a single dose of 5,000 mcg (200,000 IU) vitamin D 3 followed by 2,500 mcg (100,000 IU) each month or a placebo for a median of 3.3 years [ 126 ]. Vitamin D supplementation had no effect on the incidence rate of myocardial infarction, angina, heart failure, arrhythmia, arteriosclerosis, stroke, venous thrombosis, or death from CVD. Similarly, the VITAL clinical trial described above found that vitamin D supplements did not significantly decrease rates of heart attacks, strokes, coronary revascularization, or deaths from cardiovascular causes [ 93 ]. Moreover, the effects did not vary by baseline serum 25(OH)D levels or whether participants took the trial’s omega-3 supplement in addition to vitamin D.\nHowever, another clinical trial designed to investigate bone fracture risk found that 20 mcg (800 IU)/day vitamin D 3 (with or without calcium) or a placebo in 5,292 adults age 70 years and older for a median of 6.2 years offered protection from cardiac failure, but not myocardial infarction or stroke [ 127 ]. In the WHI clinical trial described above, daily supplementation with 10 mcg (400 IU) vitamin D 3 and 1,000 mg calcium did not affect cardiovascular disease risk during the 7-year trial [ 128 ] or during a long-term median follow-up of 22.3 years [ 95 ]. However, during this long-term follow-up period, women who received the supplements had a 6% higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease than those who received placebo [ 95 ].\nHigh serum cholesterol levels and hypertension are two of the main risk factors for CVD. The data on supplemental vitamin D and cholesterol levels are mixed, as shown in one meta-analysis of 41 clinical trials in a total of 3,434 participants (mean age 55 years). The results of this analysis showed that 0.5 mcg (20 IU) to 214 mcg (8,570 IU)/day vitamin D supplementation (mean of 2,795 IU) for 6 weeks to 3 years reduced serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels, but not high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels [ 129 ].\nStudies of the effects of vitamin D supplements on hypertension have also had mixed findings. In one meta-analysis of 46 clinical trials that included 4,541 participants, vitamin D supplements (typically 40 mcg [1,600 IU]/day or less) for a minimum of 4 weeks had no significant effects on systolic or diastolic blood pressure [ 130 ]. In contrast, another meta-analysis of 30 clinical trials in 4,744 participants (mean age 54.5 years) that administered 5 mcg (200 IU) to 300 mcg (12,000 IU)/day vitamin D 3 for a mean of 5.6 months showed that more than 20 mcg (800 IU)/day significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure in normal-weight participants who had hypertension [ 131 ]. However, more than 20 mcg (800 IU)/day vitamin D 3 , when taken with calcium supplements, significantly increased blood pressure in participants with overweight and obesity. Another meta-analysis of genetic studies in 146,581 participants (primarily adults) found that a low vitamin D status increased blood pressure and hypertension risk in people with genetic variants associated with low endogenous production of 25(OH)D [ 132 ].\nOverall, clinical trials show that vitamin D supplementation does not reduce CVD risk, even for people with low 25(OH)D status (below 20 nmol/L [12 ng/mL]) at baseline [ 93 , 126 ].\n",

    "Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D and health": "Although 25(OH)D functions as a biomarker of exposure, the extent to which 25(OH)D levels also serve as a biomarker of effect on the body (i.e., relating to health status or outcomes) is not clear [ 1 , 3 ].\nResearchers have not definitively identified serum concentrations of 25(OH)D associated with deficiency (e.g., rickets), adequacy for bone health, and overall health. After reviewing data on vitamin D needs, an expert committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) concluded that people are at risk of vitamin D deficiency at serum 25(OH)D concentrations less than 30 nmol/L (12 ng/mL; see Table 1 for definitions of deficiency and inadequacy) [ 1 ]. Some people are potentially at risk of inadequacy at 30 to 50 nmol/L (12–20 ng/mL). Levels of 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) or more are sufficient for most people. The FNB committee also noted that serum concentrations greater than 125 nmol/L (50 ng/mL) can be associated with adverse effects [ 1 ] (Table 1). The Endocrine Society has not identified 25(OH)D concentrations associated with vitamin D sufficiency, insufficiency, and deficiency and does not recommend routine testing of 25(OH)D concentrations in healthy individuals [ 11 , 12 ].\nOptimal serum concentrations of 25(OH)D for bone and general health have not been established because they are likely to vary by stage of life, by race and ethnicity, and with each physiological measure used [ 1 , 13 , 14 ]. In addition, although 25(OH)D levels rise in response to increased vitamin D intake, the relationship is nonlinear [ 1 ]. The amount of increase varies, for example, by baseline serum levels and duration of supplementation.\n",
    "Sun exposure": "Most people in the world meet at least some of their vitamin D needs through exposure to sunlight [ 1 ]. Type B UV (UVB) radiation with a wavelength of approximately 290–320 nanometers penetrates uncovered skin and converts cutaneous 7-dehydrocholesterol to previtamin D 3 , which in turn becomes vitamin D 3 . Season, time of day, length of day, cloud cover, smog, skin melanin content, and sunscreen are among the factors that affect UV radiation exposure and vitamin D synthesis. Older people and people with dark skin are less able to produce vitamin D from sunlight [ 1 ]. UVB radiation does not penetrate glass, so exposure to sunshine indoors through a window does not produce vitamin D [ 27 ].\nThe factors that affect UV radiation exposure, individual responsiveness, and uncertainties about the amount of sun exposure needed to maintain adequate vitamin D levels make it difficult to provide guidelines on how much sun exposure is required for sufficient vitamin D synthesis [ 15 , 28 ]. Some expert bodies and vitamin D researchers suggest, for example, that approximately 5–30 minutes of sun exposure, particularly between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., either daily or at least twice a week to the face, arms, hands, and legs without sunscreen usually leads to sufficient vitamin D synthesis [ 13 , 15 , 28 ]. Moderate use of commercial tanning beds that emit 2% to 6% UVB radiation is also effective [ 13 , 29 ].\nHowever, despite the importance of the sun for vitamin D synthesis, limiting skin exposure to sunlight and UV radiation from tanning beds is prudent [ 28 ]. UV radiation is a carcinogen, and UV exposure is the most preventable cause of skin cancer. Federal agencies and national organizations advise taking photoprotective measures to reduce the risk of skin cancer, including using sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher, whenever people are exposed to the sun [ 28 , 30 ]. Sunscreens with an SPF of 8 or more appear to block vitamin D-producing UV rays. In practice, however, people usually do not apply sufficient amounts of sunscreen, cover all sun-exposed skin, or reapply sunscreen regularly. Their skin probably synthesizes some vitamin D, even with typically applied sunscreen amounts [ 1 , 28 ].\n",
    "Vitamin D Intakes and Status": "Most people in the United States consume less than recommended amounts of vitamin D. An analysis of data from the 2015–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that average daily vitamin D intakes from foods and beverages were 5.1 mcg (204 IU) in men, 4.2 mcg (168 IU) in women, and 4.9 mcg (196 IU) in children age 2–19 years [ 39 ]. In fact, 2013–2016 NHANES data showed that 92% of men, more than 97% of women, and 94% of people age 1 year and older ingested less than the EAR of 10 mcg (400 IU) of vitamin D from food and beverages [ 40 ].\nThe analysis of 2015–2016 data also showed that 28% of all individuals age 2 years and older in the United States took a dietary supplement containing vitamin D [ 39 ]. In addition, 26% of participants age 2–5 years and 14% of those age 6–11 years took supplements; rates increased with age from 10% of those age 12–19 years to 49% of men and 59% of women age 60 and older. Total vitamin D intakes were three times higher with supplement use than with diet alone; the mean intake from foods and beverages alone for individuals age 2 and older was 4.8 mcg (192 IU) but increased to 19.9 mcg (796 IU) when dietary supplements were included.\nSome people take very high doses of vitamin D supplements. In 2013–2014, an estimated 3.2% of the U.S. adult population took supplements containing 100 mcg (4,000 IU) or more vitamin D [ 41 ].\nOne might expect a large proportion of the U.S. population to have vitamin D inadequacy on the basis of vitamin D intakes from foods, beverages, and even dietary supplements. However, comparing vitamin D intakes to serum 25(OH)D levels is problematic. One reason is that sun exposure affects vitamin D status, so serum 25(OH)D levels are usually higher than would be predicted on the basis of vitamin D dietary intakes alone [ 1 ]. Another reason is that animal foods contain some 25(OH)D. This form of vitamin D is not included in intake surveys and is considerably more potent than vitamins D 2 or D 3 at raising serum 25(OH)D levels [ 42 ].\nAn analysis of NHANES 2011–2014 data on serum 25(OH)D levels found that most people in the United States age 1 year and older had sufficient vitamin D intakes according to the FNB thresholds [ 43 ]. However, 18% were at risk of inadequacy (levels of 30–49 nmol/L [12–19.6 ng/mL]), and 5% were at risk of deficiency (levels below 30 nmol/L [12 ng/mL]). Four percent had levels higher than 125 nmol/L (50 ng/mL). Proportions at risk of deficiency were lowest among children age 1–5 years (0.5%), peaked at 7.6% in adults age 20–39 years, and fell to 2.9% among adults age 60 years and older; patterns were similar for risks of inadequacy. Rates of deficiency varied by race and ethnicity: 17.5% of non-Hispanic Blacks were at risk of vitamin D deficiency, as were 7.6% of non-Hispanic Asians, 5.9% of Hispanics, and 2.1% of non-Hispanic White people. Again, the pattern was similar for the risk of inadequacy. Vitamin D status in the United States remained stable in the decade between 2003–2004 and 2013–2014.\n",
    "Vitamin D Deficiency": "People can develop vitamin D deficiency when usual intakes are lower over time than recommended levels, exposure to sunlight is limited, the kidneys cannot convert 25(OH)D to its active form, or absorption of vitamin D from the digestive tract is inadequate. Diets low in vitamin D are more common in people who have milk allergy or lactose intolerance and those who consume an ovo-vegetarian or vegan diet [ 1 ].\nIn children, vitamin D deficiency is manifested as rickets, a disease characterized by a failure of bone tissue to become properly mineralized, resulting in soft bones and skeletal deformities [ 44 ]. In addition to bone deformities and pain, severe rickets can cause failure to thrive, developmental delay, hypocalcemic seizures, tetanic spasms, cardiomyopathy, and dental abnormalities [ 45 , 46 ].\nProlonged exclusive breastfeeding without vitamin D supplementation can cause rickets in infants, and, in the United States, rickets is most common among breastfed Black infants and children [ 47 ]. In one Minnesota county, the incidence rate of rickets in children younger than 3 years in the decade beginning in 2000 was 24.1 per 100,000 [ 48 ]. Rickets occurred mainly in Black children who were breastfed longer, were born with low birthweight, weighed less, and were shorter than other children. The incidence rate of rickets in the infants and children (younger than 7) seen by 2,325 pediatricians throughout Canada was 2.9 per 100,000 in 2002–2004, and almost all patients with rickets had been breastfed [ 49 ].\nThe fortification of milk (a good source of calcium) and other staples, such as breakfast cereals and margarine, with vitamin D beginning in the 1930s along with the use of cod liver oil made rickets rare in the United States [ 28 , 50 ]. However, the incidence of rickets is increasing globally, even in the United States and Europe, especially among immigrants from African, Middle-Eastern, and Asian countries [ 51 ]. Possible explanations for this increase include genetic differences in vitamin D metabolism, dietary preferences, and behaviors that lead to less sun exposure [ 45 , 46 ].\nIn adults and adolescents, vitamin D deficiency can lead to osteomalacia, in which existing bone is incompletely or defectively mineralized during the remodeling process, resulting in weak bones [ 46 ]. Signs and symptoms of osteomalacia are similar to those of rickets and include bone deformities and pain, hypocalcemic seizures, tetanic spasms, and dental abnormalities [ 45 ].\nScreening for vitamin D status is becoming a more common part of the routine laboratory bloodwork ordered by primary-care physicians, irrespective of any indications for this practice [ 6 , 52-54 ]. No studies have examined whether such screening for vitamin D deficiency results in improved health outcomes [ 55 ]. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults [ 6 ]. It added that no national professional organization recommends population screening for vitamin D deficiency.\n",
    "Groups at Risk of Vitamin D Inadequacy": "Obtaining sufficient vitamin D from natural (nonfortified) food sources alone is difficult. For many people, consuming vitamin D-fortified foods and exposing themselves to some sunlight are essential for maintaining a healthy vitamin D status. However, some groups might need dietary supplements to meet their vitamin D requirements. The following groups are among those most likely to have inadequate vitamin D status.\n",
    "Breastfed infants": "Consumption of human milk alone does not ordinarily enable infants to meet vitamin D requirements, because it provides less than 0.6 to 2.0 mcg/L (25 to 78 IU/L) [ 1 , 56 , 57 ]. The vitamin D content of human milk is related to the mother’s vitamin D status; studies suggest that the breastmilk of mothers who take daily supplements containing at least 50 mcg (2,000 IU) vitamin D 3 have higher levels of the nutrient [ 57 , 58 ].\nAlthough UVB exposure can produce vitamin D in infants, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) advises parents to keep infants younger than 6 months out of direct sunlight, dress them in protective clothing and hats, and apply sunscreen on small areas of exposed skin when sun exposure is unavoidable [ 59 ]. The AAP recommends 10 mcg (400 IU)/day vitamin D supplements for exclusively and partially breastfed infants starting shortly after birth and lasting until they are weaned and consume at least 1,000 mL/day vitamin D-fortified formula or whole milk [ 57 ]. The AAP also recommends 10 mcg (400 IU)/day supplemental vitamin D for all infants who are not breastfed and ingest less than 1,000 mL/day vitamin D-fortified formula or milk. An analysis of NHANES 2009–2016 data found that only 20.5% of breastfed infants and 31.1% of infants who were not breastfed ingested these recommended amounts of supplements [ 60 ].\n",
    "People with limited sun exposure": "Homebound individuals; people who wear long robes, dresses, or head coverings for religious reasons; and people with occupations that limit sun exposure are among the groups that are unlikely to obtain adequate amounts of vitamin D from sunlight [ 62 ]. The use of sunscreen also limits vitamin D synthesis from sunlight. However, because the extent and frequency of sunscreen use are unknown, the role that sunscreen may play in reducing vitamin D synthesis is unclear [ 1 ].\n",
    "People with dark skin": "Greater amounts of the pigment melanin in the epidermal layer of the skin result in darker skin and reduce the skin’s ability to produce vitamin D from sunlight [ 1 ]. Black Americans, for example, typically have lower serum 25(OH)D levels than White Americans. However, whether these lower levels in persons with dark skin have significant health consequences is not clear [ 14 ]. Those of African American ancestry, for example, have lower rates of bone fracture and osteoporosis than do Whites (see the section below on bone health and osteoporosis).\n",
    "People with conditions that limit fat absorption": "Because vitamin D is fat soluble, its absorption depends on the gut’s ability to absorb dietary fat [ 4 ]. Fat malabsorption is associated with medical conditions that include some forms of liver disease, cystic fibrosis, celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, and ulcerative colitis [ 1 , 63 ]. In addition to having an increased risk of vitamin D deficiency, people with these conditions might not eat certain foods, such as dairy products (many of which are fortified with vitamin D), or eat only small amounts of these foods. Individuals who have difficulty absorbing dietary fat might therefore require vitamin D supplementation [ 63 ].\n",
    "People with obesity or who have undergone gastric bypass surgery": "Individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more have lower serum 25(OH)D levels than individuals without obesity. Obesity does not affect the skin’s capacity to synthesize vitamin D. However, greater amounts of subcutaneous fat sequester more of the vitamin [ 1 ]. People with obesity might need greater intakes of vitamin D to achieve 25(OH)D levels similar to those of people with normal weight [ 1 , 64 , 65 ].\nIndividuals with obesity who have undergone gastric bypass surgery can also become vitamin D deficient. In this procedure, part of the upper small intestine, where vitamin D is absorbed, is bypassed, and vitamin D that is mobilized into the bloodstream from fat stores might not raise 25(OH)D to adequate levels over time [ 66 , 67 ]. Various expert groups—including the American Association of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, The Obesity Society, and the British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society—have developed guidelines on vitamin D screening, monitoring, and replacement before and after bariatric surgery [ 66 , 68 ]\n",
    "Vitamin D and Health": "The FNB committee that established DRIs for vitamin D found that the evidence was inadequate or too contradictory to conclude that the vitamin had any effect on a long list of potential health outcomes (e.g., on resistance to chronic diseases or functional measures), except for measures related to bone health. Similarly, in a review of data from nearly 250 studies published between 2009 and 2013, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality concluded that no relationship could be firmly established between vitamin D and health outcomes other than bone health [ 69 ]. However, because research has been conducted on vitamin D and numerous health outcomes, this section focuses on seven diseases, conditions, and interventions in which vitamin D might be involved: bone health and osteoporosis, cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), depression, multiple sclerosis (MS), type 2 diabetes, and weight loss.\nMost of the studies described in this section measured serum 25(OH)D levels using various methods that were not standardized by comparing them to the best methods. Use of unstandardized 25(OH)D measures can raise questions about the accuracy of the results and about the validity of conclusions drawn from studies that use such measures and, especially, from meta-analyses that pool data from many studies that use different unstandardized measures [ 5 , 9 , 70 ]. More information about assay standardization is available from the Vitamin D Standardization Program webpage.\n",
    "Bone health and osteoporosis": "Bone is constantly being remodeled. However, as people age—and particularly in women during menopause—bone breakdown rates overtake rates of bone building. Over time, bone density can decline, and osteoporosis can eventually develop [ 71 ].\nMore than 53 million adults in the United States have or are at risk of developing osteoporosis, which is characterized by low bone mass and structural deterioration of bone tissue that increases bone fragility and the risk of bone fractures [ 72 ]. About 2.3 million osteoporotic fractures occurred in the United States in 2015 [ 73 ]. Osteoporosis is, in part, a long-term effect of calcium and/or vitamin D insufficiency, in contrast to rickets and osteomalacia, which result from vitamin D deficiency. Osteoporosis is most often associated with inadequate calcium intakes, but insufficient vitamin D intakes contribute to osteoporosis by reducing calcium absorption [ 1 ].\nBone health also depends on support from the surrounding muscles to assist with balance and postural sway and thereby reduce the risk of falling. Vitamin D is also needed for the normal development and growth of muscle fibers. In addition, inadequate vitamin D levels can adversely affect muscle strength and lead to muscle weakness and pain (myopathy) [ 1 ].\nMost trials of the effects of vitamin D supplements on bone health also included calcium supplements, so isolating the effects of each nutrient is difficult. In addition, studies provided different amounts of nutrients and used different dosing schedules.\nAmong postmenopausal women and older men, many clinical trials have shown that supplements of both vitamin D and calcium result in small increases in bone mineral density throughout the skeleton [ 1 , 74 ]. They also help reduce fracture rates in institutionalized older people. However, the evidence on the impact of vitamin D and calcium supplements on fractures in community-dwelling individuals is inconsistent.\nThe USPSTF evaluated 11 randomized clinical trials of vitamin D and/or calcium supplementation in a total of 51,419 healthy, community-dwelling adults age 50 years and older who did not have osteoporosis, vitamin D deficiency, or prior fractures [ 75 , 76 ]. It concluded that the current evidence was insufficient to evaluate the benefits and harms of supplementation to prevent fractures. In addition, the USPSTF recommended against supplementation with 10 mcg (400 IU) or less of vitamin D and 1,000 mg or less of calcium to prevent fractures in this population, but it could not determine the balance of benefits and harms from higher doses.\nThe USPSTF also reviewed the seven published studies on the effects of vitamin D supplementation (two of them also included calcium supplementation) on the risk of falls in community-dwelling adults age 65 years or older who did not have osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency. It concluded with moderate certainty that vitamin D supplementation does not reduce the numbers of falls or injuries, such as fractures, resulting from falls [ 77 , 78 ]. Another recent systematic review also found that vitamin D and calcium supplements had no beneficial effects on fractures, falls, or bone mineral density [ 79 , 80 ]. In contrast, a meta-analysis of six trials in 49,282 older adults found that daily vitamin D (10 or 20 mcg [400 IU or 800 IU]/day) and calcium (800 or 1,200 mg/day) supplementation for a mean of 5.9 years reduced the risk of any fracture by 6% and of hip fracture by 16% [ 81 ].\nOne systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 randomized, controlled trials published through 2018 of vitamin D supplementation alone (10–20 mcg [400–800 IU]/day or more at least every week or as rarely as once a year) for 9 months to 5 years found that the supplements provided no protection from fractures in 34,243 older adults [ 81 ].\nMore recently, a 2022 ancillary study of the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL; described in the Cancer section below) investigated whether supplemental vitamin D 3 (50 mcg [2,000 IU]/day) would lower the risk of fractures in 25,871 generally healthy men age 50 years and older and women age 55 years and older over a median follow-up of 5.3 years [ 82 ]. The mean age of all participants was 67.1 years; 50.6% were women and 20.2% were Black. Most participants were vitamin D sufficient; at baseline, only 2.4% had serum 25(OH)D levels less than 30 nmol/L (12 ng/mL), and 12.9% less than 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL). Vitamin D supplementation did not lower the risk of total fractures, hip fractures, or nonvertebral fractures as compared with placebo. No substantial between-group differences in fracture incidence were found by race, ethnic group, BMI, age, baseline 25(OH)D levels, or whether participants took supplemental calcium, were at high fracture risk, or had a history of fragility fractures.\nBone mineral density, bone mass, and fracture risk are correlated with serum 25(OH)D levels in White Americans and Mexican Americans, but not in Black Americans [ 14 , 83 ]. Factors such as adiposity, skin pigmentation, vitamin D binding protein polymorphisms, and genetics contribute to differences in 25(OH)D levels between Black and White Americans.\nOne clinical trial randomized 260 Black women age 60 years and older (mean age 68.2 years) to receive 60 to 120 mcg (2,400 to 4,800 IU) per day vitamin D 3 supplementation to maintain serum 25(OH)D levels above 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) for 3 years [ 84 ]. The results showed no association between 25(OH)D levels or vitamin D dose and the risk of falling in the 184 participants who completed the study. In fact, Black Americans might have a greater risk than White Americans of falls and fractures with daily vitamin D intakes of 50 mcg (2,000 IU) or more [ 14 ]. Furthermore, the bone health of older Black American women does not appear to benefit from raising serum 25(OH)D levels beyond 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) [ 84 ].\nStudies examining the effects of supplemental vitamin D on muscle strength and on rate of decline in muscle function have had inconsistent results [ 55 ]. One recent clinical trial, for example, randomized 78 frail and near-frail adults age 65 years and older to receive 20 mcg (800 IU) vitamin D 3 , 10 mcg 25(OH)D, or placebo daily for 6 months. The groups showed no significant differences in measures of muscle strength or performance [ 85 ]. Another study randomized 100 community-dwelling men and women age 60 years and older (most were White) with serum 25(OH)D levels of 50 nmol/L (20 ng/ml) or less to 800 IU vitamin D 3 or placebo for 1 year [ 86 ]. Participants in the treatment group whose serum 25(OH)D level was less than 70 nmol/L (28 ng/ml) after 4 months received an additional 800 IU/day vitamin D 3 . Despite increasing serum 25(OH)D levels to an average of more than 80 nmol/L (32 ng/ml), vitamin D supplementation did not affect lower-extremity power, strength, or lean mass.\nAll adults should consume recommended amounts of vitamin D and calcium from foods and supplements if needed. Older women and men should consult their health care providers about their needs for both nutrients as part of an overall plan to maintain bone health and to prevent or treat osteoporosis.\n",
    "Depression": "Vitamin D is involved in various brain processes, and vitamin D receptors are present on neurons and glia in areas of the brain thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of depression [ 133 ].\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 observational studies that included a total of 31,424 adults (mean age ranging from 27.5 to 77 years) found an association between deficient or low levels of 25(OH)D and depression [ 133 ].\nClinical trials, however, do not support these findings. For example, a meta-analysis of nine trials with a total of 4,923 adult participants diagnosed with depression or depressive symptoms found no significant reduction in symptoms after supplementation with vitamin D [ 134 ]. The trials administered different amounts of vitamin D (ranging from 10 mcg [400 IU]/day to 1,000 mcg [40,000 IU]/week). They also had different study durations (5 days to 5 years), mean participant ages (range, 22 years to 75 years), and baseline 25(OH)D levels; furthermore, some but not all studies administered concurrent antidepressant medications.\nThree trials conducted since that meta-analysis also found no effect of vitamin D supplementation on depressive symptoms. One trial included 206 adults (mean age 52 years) who were randomized to take a bolus dose of 2,500 mcg (100,000 IU) vitamin D 3 followed by 500 mcg (20,000 IU)/week or a placebo for 4 months [ 135 ]. Most participants had minimal or mild depression, had a low mean baseline 25(OH) level of 33.8 nmol/L (13.5 ng/mL), and were not taking antidepressants. The second trial included 155 adults age 60–80 years who had clinically relevant depressive symptoms, no major depressive disorder, and serum 25(OH)D levels less than 50 to 70 nmol/L (20 to 28 ng/mL) depending on the season; in addition, they were not taking antidepressants [ 136 , 137 ]. Participants were randomized to take either 30 mcg (1,200 IU)/day vitamin D 3 or a placebo for 1 year. In the VITAL trial described above, 16,657 men and women 50 years of age and older with no history of depression and 1,696 with an increased risk of recurrent depression (that had not been medically treated for the past 2 years) were randomized to take 50 mcg (2,000 IU)/day vitamin D 3 (with or without fish oil) or a placebo for a median of 5.3 years [ 138 ]. The groups showed no significant differences in the incidence and recurrent rates of depression, clinically relevant depressive symptoms, or changes in mood scores.\nOverall, clinical trials did not find that vitamin D supplements helped prevent or treat depressive symptoms or mild depression, especially in middle-age to older adults who were not taking prescription antidepressants. No studies have evaluated whether vitamin D supplements may benefit individuals under medical care for clinical depression who have low or deficient 25(OH)D levels and are taking antidepressant medication.\n",
    "Multiple sclerosis": "MS is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that damages the myelin sheath surrounding and protecting nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. This damage hinders or blocks messages between the brain and body, leading to clinical features, such as vision loss, motor weakness, spasticity, ataxia, tremor, sensory loss, and cognitive impairment [ 139 , 140 ]. Some people with MS eventually lose the ability to write, speak, or walk.\nThe geographical distribution of MS around the world is unequal. Few people near the equator develop the disease, whereas the prevalence is higher further north and south. This uneven distribution has led to speculation that lower vitamin D levels in people who have less sunlight exposure might predispose them to the disease [ 140 ].\nMany epidemiological and genetic studies have shown an association between MS and low 25(OH)D levels before and after the disease begins [ 140 ]. Observational studies suggest that adequate vitamin D levels might reduce the risk of contracting MS and, once MS is present, decrease the risk of relapse and slow the disease's progression [ 141 ]. One study, for example, tested 25(OH)D levels in 1,092 women in Finland an average of 9 years before their MS diagnosis and compared their outcomes with those of 2,123 similar women who did not develop MS [ 142 ]. More than half the women who developed MS had deficient or insufficient vitamin D levels. Women with 25(OH)D levels of less than 30 nmol/L (12 ng/mL) had a 43% higher MS risk than women with levels of 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) or higher. Among the women with two or more serum 25(OH)D samples taken before diagnosis (which reduced random measurement variation), a 50 nmol/L increase in 25(OH)D was associated with a 41% reduced risk of MS, and 25(OH)D levels less than 30 nmol/L were associated with an MS risk that was twice as high as levels of 50 nmol/L or higher.\nTwo earlier prospective studies of similar design—one in the United States with 444 non-Hispanic White individuals [ 143 ] and the other with 576 individuals in northern Sweden [ 144 ]—found that levels of 25(OH)D greater than 99.1 nmol/L (39.6 ng/mL) and at least 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL), respectively, were associated with a 61%–62% lower risk of MS.\nNo clinical trials have examined whether vitamin D supplementation can prevent the onset of MS, but several have investigated whether supplemental vitamin D can help manage the disease. A 2018 Cochrane Review analyzed 12 such trials that had a total of 933 participants with MS; the reviewers judged all of these trials to be of low quality [ 140 ]. Overall, vitamin D supplementation, when compared with placebo administration, had no effect on relevant clinical outcomes, such as recurrent relapse or worsened disability.\nExperts have reached no firm consensus on whether vitamin D can help prevent MS given the lack of clinical trial evidence [ 145 ]. In addition, studies have not consistently shown that vitamin D supplementation tempers the signs and symptoms of active MS or reduces rates of relapse.\n",
    "Type 2 diabetes": "Vitamin D plays a role in glucose metabolism. It stimulates insulin secretion via the vitamin D receptor on pancreatic beta cells and reduces peripheral insulin resistance through vitamin D receptors in the muscles and liver [ 146 ]. Vitamin D might be involved in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes through its effects on glucose metabolism and insulin signaling as well as its ability to reduce inflammation and improve pancreatic beta-cell function [ 147 , 148 ].\nObservational studies have linked lower serum 25(OH)D levels to an increased risk of diabetes, but their results might have been confounded by the fact that many participants were overweight or had obesity and were therefore more predisposed to developing diabetes and having lower 25(OH)D levels [ 1 ]. A review of 71 observational studies in adults with and without type 2 diabetes from 16 countries found a significant inverse relationship between vitamin D status and blood sugar levels in participants who did and did not have diabetes [ 149 ].\nIn contrast to observational studies, clinical trials provide little support for the benefits of vitamin D supplementation for glucose homeostasis. One trial included 65 adult men and women (mean age 32 years) with overweight or obesity who were otherwise healthy, did not have diabetes, and had low serum vitamin D levels (at or below 50 nmol/L [20 ng/mL]) [ 150 ]. The investigators randomly assigned participants to receive either a bolus oral dose of 2,500 mcg (100,000 IU) vitamin D 3 followed by 100 mcg (4,000 IU)/day or a placebo for 16 weeks. In the 54 participants who completed the study, vitamin D supplementation did not improve insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion in comparison with placebo.\nOne systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated 35 clinical trials that included 43,407 adults with normal glucose tolerance, prediabetes, or type 2 diabetes who received a median of 83 mcg (3,332 IU)/day vitamin D supplements or placebo for a median of 16 weeks [ 151 ]. Vitamin D had no significant effects on glucose homeostasis, insulin secretion or resistance, or hemoglobin A1c levels (a measure of average blood sugar levels over the previous 2–3 months), irrespective of the study population, vitamin D dose, or trial quality.\nSeveral trials have investigated whether vitamin D supplementation can prevent the transition from prediabetes to diabetes in patients with adequate 25(OH)D levels, and all have had negative results. In a trial in Norway, 511 men and women age 25–80 years (mean age 62 years) with prediabetes received 500 mcg (20,000 IU) vitamin D 3 or a placebo each week for 5 years [ 152 ]. The results showed no significant differences in rates of progression to type 2 diabetes; in serum glucose, insulin, or hemoglobin A1c levels; or in measures of insulin resistance. At baseline, participants had an adequate mean serum 25(OH)D level of 60 nmol/L (24 ng/mL).\nThe largest trial to date of vitamin D supplements for diabetes prevention randomized 2,423 men and women age 25 years and older (mean age 60 years) with prediabetes and overweight or obesity (mean BMI of 32.1) to 100 mcg (4,000 IU)/day vitamin D 3 or placebo for a median of 2.5 years [ 148 ]. Most participants (78%) had adequate serum levels of vitamin D at baseline (at least 50 nmol/L [20 ng/mL]). Vitamin D did not significantly prevent the development of diabetes in comparison with placebo. However, a post hoc analysis showed a 62% lower incidence of diabetes among participants with low baseline serum 25(OH)D levels (less than 30 nmol/L [12 ng/mL]) who took the vitamin D supplement than among those who took the placebo [ 148 , 153 ].\nStudies have also assessed the value of vitamin D supplementation for managing diabetes, and they have found that the vitamin offers limited benefits. One meta-analysis of 20 clinical trials compared the effects of 0.5 mcg (20 IU)/day to 1,250 mcg (50,000 IU)/week vitamin D supplementation for 2–6 months with those of placebo on glycemic control in 2,703 adults from around the world who had diabetes [ 146 ]. The vitamin D reduced insulin resistance to a small but significant degree, especially in people taking more than 50 mcg (2,000 IU)/day who were vitamin D deficient at baseline, had good glycemic control, did not have obesity, and were of Middle Eastern ethnicity. However, the supplementation had no significant effects on fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, or fasting insulin levels.\nClinical trials to date provide little evidence that vitamin D supplementation helps maintain glucose homeostasis, reduces the risk of progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes, or helps manage the disease, particularly in vitamin D-replete individuals.\n",
    "Weight loss": "Observational studies indicate that greater body weights are associated with lower vitamin D status, and individuals with obesity frequently have marginal or deficient circulating 25(OH)D levels [ 154 ]. However, clinical trials do not support a cause-and-effect relationship between vitamin D and weight loss.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of 15 weight-loss intervention studies that used caloric restriction, exercise, or both, but not necessarily vitamin D supplementation or other treatments, found that people who lost weight had significantly greater increases in serum 25(OH)D levels than those who maintained their weight [ 155 ]. In another study, 10 mcg (400 IU)/day vitamin D and 1,000 mg/day calcium supplementation slightly, but significantly, reduced weight gain amounts in comparison with placebo in postmenopausal women, especially those with a baseline total calcium intake of less than 1,200 mg/day [ 156 ]. However, a meta-analysis of 12 vitamin D supplementation trials (including 5 in which body composition measurements were primary outcomes) found that vitamin D supplements without calorie restriction did not affect body weight or fat mass when the results were compared with those of placebo [ 157 ].\nOverall, the available research suggests that consuming higher amounts of vitamin D or taking vitamin D supplements does not promote weight loss.\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Vitamin D": "Excess amounts of vitamin D are toxic. Because vitamin D increases calcium absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, vitamin D toxicity results in marked hypercalcemia (total calcium greater than 11.1 mg/dL, beyond the normal range of 8.4 to 10.2 mg/dL), hypercalciuria, and high serum 25(OH)D levels (typically greater than 375 nmol/l [150 ng/mL]) [ 158 ]. Hypercalcemia, in turn, can lead to nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness, neuropsychiatric disturbances, pain, loss of appetite, dehydration, polyuria, excessive thirst, and kidney stones.\nIn extreme cases, vitamin D toxicity causes renal failure, calcification of soft tissues throughout the body (including in coronary vessels and heart valves), cardiac arrhythmias, and even death. Vitamin D toxicity has been caused by consumption of dietary supplements that contained excessive vitamin D amounts because of manufacturing errors, that were taken inappropriately or in excessive amounts, or that were incorrectly prescribed by physicians, [ 158-160 ].\nExperts do not believe that excessive sun exposure results in vitamin D toxicity because thermal activation of previtamin D 3 in the skin gives rise to various non-vitamin D forms that limit formation of vitamin D 3 . Some vitamin D 3 is also converted to nonactive forms [ 1 ]. However, frequent use of tanning beds, which provide artificial UV radiation, can lead to 25(OH)D levels well above 375–500 nmol/L (150–200 ng/mL) [ 161-163 ].\nThe combination of high intakes of calcium (about 2,100 mg/day from food and supplements) with moderate amounts of vitamin D (about 19 mcg [765 IU]/day from food and supplements) increased the risk of kidney stones by 17% over 7 years among 36,282 postmenopausal women who were randomly assigned to take 1,000 mg/day calcium and 10 mcg (400 IU)/day vitamin D or a placebo [ 164 ]. However, other, shorter (from 24 weeks to 5 years) clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation alone or with calcium in adults found greater risks of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria, but not of kidney stones [ 165 , 166 ].\nThe FNB established ULs for vitamin D in 2010 (Table 4) [ 1 ]. While acknowledging that signs and symptoms of toxicity are unlikely at daily intakes below 250 mcg (10,000 IU), the FNB noted that even vitamin D intakes lower than the ULs might have adverse health effects over time. The FNB recommended avoiding serum 25(OH)D levels above approximately 125–150 nmol/L (50–60 ng/mL), and it found that even lower serum levels (approximately 75–120 nmol/L [30–48 ng/mL]) are associated with increases in rates of all-cause mortality, risk of cancer at some sites (e.g., pancreas), risk of cardiovascular events, and number of falls and fractures among older adults.\n",
    "Orlistat": "The weight-loss drug orlistat (Xenical and alli), together with a reduced-fat diet, can reduce the absorption of vitamin D from food and supplements, leading to lower 25(OH)D levels [ 167-170 ].\n",
    "Statins": "Statin medications reduce cholesterol synthesis. Because endogenous vitamin D is derived from cholesterol, statins may also reduce vitamin D synthesis [ 170 ]. In addition, high intakes of vitamin D, especially from supplements, might reduce the potency of atorvastatin (Lipitor), lovastatin (Altoprev and Mevacor), and simvastatin (FloLipid and Zocor), because these statins and vitamin D appear to compete for the same metabolizing enzyme [ 170-173 ].\n",
    "Steroids": "Corticosteroid medications, such as prednisone (Deltasone, Rayos, and Sterapred), are often prescribed to reduce inflammation. These medications can reduce calcium absorption and impair vitamin D metabolism [ 174-176 ]. In the NHANES 2001–2006 survey, 25(OH)D deficiency (less than 25 nmol/L [10 ng/mL]) was more than twice as common among children and adults who reported oral steroid use (11%) than in nonusers (5%) [ 177 ].\n",
    "Thiazide diuretics": "Thiazide diuretics (e.g., Hygroton, Lozol, and Microzide) decrease urinary calcium excretion. The combination of these diuretics with vitamin D supplements (which increase intestinal calcium absorption) might lead to hypercalcemia, especially among older adults and individuals with compromised renal function or hyperparathyroidism [ 170 , 178 , 179 ].\n",
    "Vitamin D and Healthful Diets": "The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Milk, many ready-to-eat cereals, and some brands of yogurt and orange juice are fortified with vitamin D. Cheese naturally contains small amounts of vitamin D. Vitamin D is added to some margarines. Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. Fatty fish, such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel, are very good sources of vitamin D. Beef liver and egg yolks have small amounts of vitamin D. Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Limits alcoholic beverages. Stays within your daily calorie needs.\nMilk, many ready-to-eat cereals, and some brands of yogurt and orange juice are fortified with vitamin D. Cheese naturally contains small amounts of vitamin D.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet .\n",
    "Introduction": "This fact sheet provides an overview of selected ingredients in dietary supplements designed or claimed to enhance exercise and athletic performance. Manufacturers and sellers promote these products, sometimes referred to as ergogenic aids, by claiming that they improve strength or endurance, increase exercise efficiency, achieve a performance goal more quickly, and increase tolerance for more intense training. These effects are the main focus of this fact sheet. Some people also use ergogenic aids to prepare the body for exercise, reduce the chance of injury during training, and enhance recovery from exercise [ 1 , 2 ].\nDietary supplements to enhance exercise and athletic performance come in a variety of forms, including tablets, capsules, liquids, powders, and bars. Many of these products contain numerous ingredients in varied combinations and amounts. Among the more common ingredients are amino acids, protein, creatine, and caffeine. According to one estimate, retail sales of the category of sports nutrition supplements totaled $5.67 billion in 2016, or 13.8% of $41.16 billion total sales for dietary supplements and related nutrition products for that year [ 3 ].\nSeveral surveys have indicated the extent of dietary supplement use for bodybuilding and to enhance exercise and athletic performance:\nInternational surveys found that two-thirds of 3,887 adult and adolescent elite track and field athletes participating in world-championship competitions took one or more dietary supplements containing such ingredients as vitamins, minerals, creatine, caffeine, and amino acids [ 4 ]. Supplement use increased with age and was significantly more common among women than men. A survey of 1,248 students age 16 years or older in five U.S. colleges and universities in 2009–2010 found that 66% reported use of any dietary supplement. The reasons for use included enhanced muscle strength (20% of users), performance enhancement (19% of users), and increased endurance (7% of users) [ 5 ]. Products taken for these purposes included protein, amino acids, herbal supplements, caffeine, creatine, and combination products. In a national survey of about 21,000 U.S. college athletes, respondents reported taking protein products (41.7%), energy drinks and shots (28.6%), creatine (14.0%), amino acids (12.1%), multivitamins with caffeine (5.7%), beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB; 0.2%), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA; 0.1%), and an unspecified mix of testosterone boosters (1.6%) [ 6 ]. Men were much more likely to take performance-enhancing products than women, except for energy drinks and shots. Among the sports with the highest percentage of users of performance-enhancing products were ice hockey, wrestling, and baseball among the men and volleyball, swimming, and ice hockey among the women. In a review of studies on adolescent use of performance-enhancing substances, the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that protein, creatine, and caffeine were the most commonly used ingredients and that use increased with age [ 7 ]. Although athletes used these ingredients more than nonathletes, teenagers not involved in organized athletic activities often took them to enhance their appearance. A survey of 106,698 U.S. military personnel in 2007–2008 found that 22.8% of the men and 5.3% of the women reported using bodybuilding supplements, such as creatine and amino acids, and 40.5% of the men and 35.5% of the women reported using energy supplements that might contain caffeine and/or energy-enhancing herbs [ 8 ]. Use of these products was positively associated with deployment to combat situations, being younger than 29 years, being physically active, and reporting 5 or fewer hours of sleep a night.\nIt is difficult to make generalizations about the extent of dietary supplement use by athletes because the studies on this topic are heterogeneous. However, the data suggest that [ 9 ]:\nA larger proportion of athletes than the general U.S. population takes dietary supplements. Elite athletes (e.g., professional athletes and those who compete on a national or international level) use dietary supplements more often than their nonelite counterparts. The supplements used by male and female athletes are similar, except that a larger proportion of women use iron and a larger proportion of men take vitamin E, protein, and creatine.\nFor any individual to physically perform at his or her best, a nutritionally adequate diet and sufficient hydration are critical. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans [ 10 ] and MyPlate [ 11 ] recommend such an eating plan for everyone. Athletes require adequate daily amounts of calories, fluids, carbohydrates (to maintain blood glucose levels and replace muscle glycogen; typically 1.4 to 4.5 g/lb body weight [3 to 10 g/kg body weight]), protein (0.55 to 0.9 g/lb body weight [1.2 to 2.0 g/kg body weight]), fat (20% to 35% of total calories), and vitamins and minerals [ 12 ].\nA few dietary supplements might enhance performance only when they add to, but do not substitute for, this dietary foundation. Athletes engaging in endurance activities lasting more than an hour or performed in extreme environments (e.g., hot temperatures or high altitudes) might need to replace lost fluids and electrolytes and consume additional carbohydrates for energy. Even with proper nutritional preparation, the results of taking any dietary supplement(s) for exercise and athletic performance vary by level of training; the nature, intensity, and duration of the activity; and the environmental conditions [ 13 ].\nSellers claim that dozens of ingredients in dietary supplements can enhance exercise and athletic performance. Well-trained elite and recreational athletes might use products containing one or more of these ingredients to train harder, improve performance, and achieve a competitive edge. However, the National Athletic Trainers' Association acknowledges in a position statement that because the outcomes of studies of various performance-enhancing substances are often equivocal, using these substances can be controversial and confusing [ 14 ].\nMost studies to assess the potential value and safety of supplements to enhance exercise and athletic performance include only conditioned athletes. Therefore, it is often not clear whether the supplements discussed in this fact sheet may be of value to recreational exercisers or individuals who engage in athletic activity only occasionally. In addition, much of the research on these supplements involves young adults (more often male than female) and not adolescents who may also use them against the advice of pediatric and high-school professional associations [ 7 , 15 ]. The quality of many studies is limited by their small samples and short durations, use of performance tests that do not simulate real-world conditions or are unreliable or irrelevant, and poor control of confounding variables [ 12 ]. Furthermore, the benefits and risks shown for the supplements might not apply to the supplement's use to enhance types of physical performance not assessed in the studies. In most cases, additional research is needed to fully understand the efficacy and safety of particular ingredients.\n",

    "Selected Ingredients in Dietary Supplements for Exercise and Athletic Performance": "Many exercise and athletic-performance dietary supplements in the marketplace contain multiple ingredients (especially those marketed for muscle growth and strength). However, much of the research has focused only on single ingredients. One, therefore, cannot know or predict the effects and safety of combinations in these multi-ingredient products unless clinical trials have investigated that particular combination. Furthermore, the amounts of these ingredients vary widely among products. In some cases, the products contain proprietary blends of ingredients listed in order by weight, but labels do not provide the amount of each ingredient in the blend. Manufacturers and sellers of dietary supplements for exercise and athletic performance rarely fund or conduct scientific research on their proprietary products of a caliber that reputable biomedical journals require for publication.\nTable 1 briefly summarizes the findings discussed in more detail in this fact sheet on the safety and efficacy of selected ingredients in dietary supplements to enhance exercise and athletic performance. Some research-derived data are available on these ingredients on which to base a judgment about their potential value to aid exercise and athletic performance. These dietary supplement ingredients are listed and discussed in the table, and in the text that follows the table, in alphabetical order.\n* References to support statements in Table 1 are provided in subsequent text. ** The evidence of efficacy and safety is for the individual ingredients. The efficacy and safety of these ingredients might be different when they are combined with other ingredients in a product or training plan.\nIn the text below, each ingredient's section begins with an introduction, followed by a summary of the scientific evidence of that ingredient's efficacy and safety. Each section concludes with information and advice from expert sources, when available, on use of the ingredient as an ergogenic aid.\n",
    "Antioxidants (vitamin C, vitamin E, and coenzyme Q10)": "Exercise increases the body’s consumption of oxygen and induces oxidative stress, leading to the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (i.e., free radicals) and the creation of more oxidized molecules in various tissues, including muscle. In theory, free radicals could impair exercise performance by impeding muscles' ability to produce force, thereby accelerating muscle damage and fatigue and producing inflammation and soreness [ 16-18 ]. Some researchers have suggested that supplements containing antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E and coenzyme Q 10 (CoQ 10 ), could reduce this free-radical formation, thereby minimizing skeletal muscle damage and fatigue and promoting recovery [ 19 ].\nStudies suggest that the use of large doses of antioxidant supplements, especially vitamins C and E, may actually reduce rather than promote some of the beneficial effects of exercise. One study, for example, randomly assigned 54 healthy Norwegian men and women age 20–30 years, most of whom were recreational exercisers, to receive 1,000 mg vitamin C and 235 mg (about 520 IU) vitamin E as DL-alpha-tocopherol or a placebo daily for 11 weeks while engaging in an endurance training program consisting mostly of running. Compared with placebo, the supplements had no effect on maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 max, a measure of aerobic fitness and endurance capacity) or running performance. However, they significantly lowered levels of biochemical markers related to mitochondrial creation and exercise-induced cell signaling, thereby diminishing the desirable training-induced adaptations within skeletal muscle [ 20 ]. The same research group conducted another trial using the same doses of vitamins C and E in 32 young men and women who followed a strength-training program for 10 weeks. Compared with placebo, the supplements did not affect muscle growth, but they significantly reduced the gain in arm strength as measured by biceps curls and blunted cellular signaling pathways linked to muscle hypertrophy [ 21 ]. Another study randomly assigned 18 young men age 20 to 34 years to receive 120 mg/day CoQ 10 for 22 days or a placebo [ 22 ]. After 7 days of high-intensity cycling sprints, the CoQ 10 group had, on average, a significantly smaller improvement in mean power output than the placebo group, suggesting a poorer adaptation to training.\nThe preponderance of research to date suggests that exercise-induced reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide are beneficial. These free radicals induce adaptive changes in muscle that lead to greater production of mitochondria and hypertrophy of myofibers [ 17 , 21 , 23 , 24 ]. Exposure of cells to high concentrations of various antioxidant supplements (of which vitamins C and/or E have the most evidence) appears to blunt or block cell signaling and thereby inhibit some favorable physiological and physical adaptations to exercise. However, these adaptations might not prevent improvements in VO 2 max or endurance performance [ 25 ].\nStudies on the safety of vitamins C, E, and other antioxidant supplements taken during exercise show no evidence of adverse effects, aside from potentially reducing some of the benefits of exercise, but such studies have only lasted a few weeks or months. The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) of vitamin C that the Food and Nutrition Board established as the maximum amount associated with little or no risk of adverse health effects is 1,800 mg/day for adolescents and 2,000 mg/day for adults [ 26 ]. These amounts are substantially higher than the doses that studies have typically used for exercise and athletic performance. The UL of vitamin E, at 800 mg/day for adolescents and 1,000 mg/day (1,100–1,500 IU) for adults, is likewise higher than the dose that these studies typically used [ 26 ].\nAmong the potential adverse effects of excess vitamin C are diarrhea, nausea, abdominal cramps, and other gastrointestinal disturbances. The intake of excessive amounts of vitamin E increases the risks of hemorrhagic effects. Moreover, results from a large clinical trial show that vitamin E supplements, even at doses below the UL (400 IU/day taken for several years), might increase men's risk of prostate cancer [ 27 ]. The side effects of CoQ 10 are mild and can include fatigue, insomnia, rashes, nausea, upper abdominal pain, heartburn, sensitivity to light, irritability, dizziness, and headaches [ 28 ].\nLittle research supports the use as ergogenic aids of antioxidant supplements containing greater amounts than those available from a nutritionally adequate diet [ 19 , 25 ]. In fact, they can adversely affect some measures of exercise and athletic performance. The Australian Institute of Sport, part of the government of Australia, does not recommend supplementation with vitamins C and E by athletes, except when they use these products as part of a research protocol or with proper monitoring [ 29 ].\nMore information on vitamin C and vitamin E is available in the Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) health professional fact sheets on these nutrients.\n",
    "Arginine": "L-arginine is an amino acid found in many protein-containing foods, especially animal products and nuts. The typical dietary intake is 4–5 grams/day [ 30 ]. The body also synthesizes arginine (from citrulline), mainly in the kidneys.\nSome experts suggest that taking arginine in supplement form enhances exercise and athletic performance in several ways [ 30-32 ]. First, some arginine is converted to nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator that can increase blood flow and the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to skeletal muscle. Second, increased vasodilation can speed up the removal of metabolic waste products related to muscle fatigue, such as lactate and ammonia, that the body produces during exercise. Third, arginine serves as a precursor for the synthesis of creatine, which helps supply muscle with energy for short-term, intense activity. Fourth, arginine may increase the secretion of human growth hormone (HGH), which in turn increases insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels, both of which stimulate muscle growth.\nThe research to support supplemental arginine as a performance enhancer is limited and conflicting. Overall, it suggests that doses of 2–20 g/day arginine have little to no effect on performance in either anaerobic or aerobic exercise [ 30 , 31 ]. Furthermore, arginine typically had no effect on nitric oxide concentration, blood flow, or exercise metabolites (e.g., lactate and ammonia), especially when well-trained athletes—including cyclists, tennis players, and judo practitioners—took the supplement for 1–28 days [ 30 ]. A recent review assessed 54 clinical studies examining the effects of arginine supplementation on strength performance, endurance, muscle blood volume and flow, cardiorespiratory measures, and nitric oxide production in healthy, active adults. The authors concluded that supplemental arginine (either alone or, more commonly, in combination with other ingredients, such as branched-chain amino acids [BCAAs] and lysine) provided little or no enhancement of athletic performance and did not improve recovery from exhaustion [ 33 ]. Most of the studies included few participants, primarily young men age 18–25 years (only four studies included women), and lasted only 4–8 weeks (with none lasting 3 months or longer). In the 18 studies that compared arginine alone with a placebo, the most common doses were 2–10 g/day as a single dose and up to 20 g/day divided into three doses.\nResearch on the ability of supplemental arginine to raise HGH and IGF-1 serum concentrations also has had conflicting findings. Depending on the study (and therefore participants’ age, fitness level, and use of other supplements as well as the nature and duration of the exercise), extra arginine might either reduce HGH secretion [ 34 ] or raise HGH and IGF-1 secretion [ 35 ]. Even raised HGH secretion, however, might not translate into more blood flow into muscle or greater protein synthesis [ 31 ]. Little evidence shows supplemental arginine by itself increases muscle creatine concentrations or is superior or complementary to direct consumption of creatine [ 30 ].\nMost study results suggest that up to 9 g/day arginine for several days or weeks is safe and well tolerated. At doses of 9–30 g/day, the most commonly reported adverse reactions are gastrointestinal discomfort, such as diarrhea and nausea, and slightly reduced blood pressure [ 33 , 36 , 37 ]. The safety of taking high-dose arginine supplements for more than 3 months is not known [ 33 ].\nArginine supplementation’s ability to enhance strength, improve exercise or athletic performance, or promote muscular recovery after exercise has little scientific support [ 30-33 , 38 , 39 ].\n",
    "Beetroot or beet juice": "Beets are one of the richest food sources of inorganic nitrate. Ingested nitrate might enhance exercise and athletic performance in several ways, primarily through its conversion into nitric oxide in the body. Nitric acid is a potent vasodilator that can increase blood flow and the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to skeletal muscle. Ingested nitrate might also enhance performance by dilating blood vessels in exercising muscle when oxygen levels decline, thereby increasing oxygen and nutrient delivery, reducing the oxygen cost of submaximal exercise, attenuating the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-creatine phosphate energy system's cost associated with skeletal muscle force production, and improving oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria [ 40 , 41 ]. Beetroot is available as a juice or juice concentrate and in powdered form; the amount of nitrate can vary considerably among products.\nA growing number of clinical trials investigating beetroot juice or concentrate as an ergogenic aid have been published since 2007. Beetroot has generally improved performance and endurance to different extents compared with placebo among runners, swimmers, rowers, and cyclists in time trials and time-to-exhaustion tests, but not in all studies [ 40 , 41-45 ]. Performance benefits are more likely in recreationally active nonathletes than elite athletes [ 42 , 46 ]. One study in 10 recreationally active, young male cyclists suggested a dose-response relationship [ 47 ]. Although consuming beetroot juice concentrate on each of 4 days to supply 4.2 mmol nitrate (70 ml) provided no performance benefits compared with placebo, larger amounts of juice supplying 8.4 mmol nitrate (140 ml) did. However, consumption of even more beetroot juice supplying 16.8 mmol nitrate (280 ml) produced no further performance benefits. There has been little study of the effects of beetroot on anaerobic performance, such as high-volume resistance exercise with many repetitions [ 40 ].\nMore research is needed to clarify the potential benefits of nitrate supplementation from beetroot juice on exercise and athletic performance and to determine the best doses and dosing protocols [ 48 ]. No research has assessed longer term supplementation with beetroot-derived nitrate beyond several weeks as an ergogenic aid.\nStudies have not identified any safety concerns with the consumption of beetroot juice in moderate amounts (about 2 cups/day) for several weeks. The amount of nitrate that this amount of juice provides is less than half the total nitrate consumption from a diet rich in vegetables and fruits [ 49 ]. Although not a safety concern, beetroot consumption can color the urine pink or red due to the excretion of red pigments in the beets [ 50 ].\nIn a position statement, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND), the Dietitians of Canada (DoC), and the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) state that nitrate sources, such as beetroot juice, enhance exercise tolerance and economy and they improve endurance exercise performance in recreational athletes [ 12 ]. The Australian Institute of Sport supports the use of beetroot juice for improving sports performance in suitable athletic competitions under the direction of an expert in sports medicine, but it notes that more research might be required to understand how the supplement should be used for best results [ 29 ].\nMost studies have used 500 ml/day (about 2 cups) of beetroot juice taken once (about 2.5 to 3 hours before exercise) or daily for up to 15 days [ 40 ]. This amount of juice provides about 5–11 mmol (or 310–682 mg) nitrate, depending on the product [ 41 ]. Potential benefits persist for up to 24 hours after ingestion [ 40 ]. The labels on beetroot juice and concentrate usually indicate that these products are foods and not dietary supplements. Some dietary supplements contain beetroot powder in varying amounts, but studies have not assessed whether these are viable alternatives to beetroot juice or beetroot-juice concentrate.\n",
    "Beta-alanine": "Beta-alanine, a type of amino acid that the body does not incorporate into proteins, is the rate-limiting precursor to the synthesis of carnosine—a dipeptide of histidine and beta-alanine—in skeletal muscle. Carnosine helps buffer changes in muscle pH from the anaerobic glycolysis that provides energy during high-intensity exercise but results in the buildup of hydrogen ions as lactic acid accumulates and dissociates to form lactate, leading to reduced force and to fatigue [ 51 ]. More carnosine in muscle leads to greater potential attenuation of exercise-induced reductions in pH, which could enhance performance of intense activities of short to moderate duration, such as rowing and swimming [ 52 ].\nBeta-alanine is produced in the liver, and relatively small amounts are present in animal-based foods such as meat, poultry, and fish. Estimated dietary intakes range from none in vegans to about 1 g/day in heavy meat eaters [ 52 ]. Carnosine is present in animal-based foods, such as beef and pork. However, oral consumption of carnosine is an inefficient method of increasing muscle carnosine concentrations because the dipeptide is digested into its constituent amino acids. Consumption of beta-alanine, in contrast, reliably increases the amount of carnosine in the body. Four to six grams of beta-alanine for 10 weeks, for example, can increase muscle carnosine levels by up to 80%, especially in trained athletes, although the magnitude of response differs widely [ 53 , 54 ]. For example, in one study of young, physically active but untrained adult men who took 4.8 g/day beta-alanine for 5–6 weeks, the percent increase in muscle carnosine content after 9 weeks of follow-up ranged from 2% to 69% [ 55 ]. Among the low responders, the duration of the washout period when beta alanine concentrations returned to baseline values was less than half that for the high responders (6 weeks vs. 15 weeks).\nStudies have evaluated beta-alanine as a potential ergogenic aid with a variety of participants, exercise and activity protocols, and dosing regimens. Some studies suggest that beta-alanine consumption could provide small performance benefits in competitive events requiring high-intensity effort over a short period, such as rowing, swimming, and team sports (e.g., hockey and football) that involve repeated sprints and intermittent activity [ 52 ]. Other studies have found no such benefits [ 53 ]. Evidence is conflicting on whether beta-alanine consumption improves performance in endurance activities, such as cycling [ 53 , 56 ]. Experts have not reached consensus on whether beta-alanine consumption primarily benefits trained athletes or recreationally active individuals [ 53 , 57 ]. Studies provide little consistent evidence of a relationship between the dose of beta-alanine and performance effect [ 51 , 58 ].\nThe authors of a Department of Defense-sponsored review concluded that the limited evidence from 20 human trials did not support consumption of beta-alanine (alone or in combination products) by active adults to enhance athletic performance or improve recovery from exercise-related exhaustion [ 59 ]. Most of the studies in this review included young men age 18–25 years who took 1.6–6.4 g/day beta-alanine supplements (in two to four separate servings) over 4–8 weeks. In contrast, the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) concluded from its literature review that beta-alanine supplements (4–6 g/day consumed for at least 2–4 weeks) can improve high-intensity exercise performance that lasts more than 60 seconds, especially in time-to-exhaustion tasks [ 54 ]. However, performance benefits are more modest in exercise tests lasting more than 4 minutes because aerobic metabolic pathways increasingly meet energy demands. The ISSN called for more research to determine whether beta-alanine increases the strength and muscle mass that regular resistance exercise, such as weightlifting, can produce.\nThe authors of the most recent review of studies on beta-alanine's effects on exercise concluded that supplementation has a statistically significant and positive effect on performance (including in both isolated-limb and whole-body exercises), especially in protocols lasting 30 seconds to 10 minutes [ 58 ]. However, this review also highlighted the fact that small studies of short duration using varied exercise and supplement protocols dominate this scientific literature. The 40 placebo-controlled studies reviewed, for example, employed 65 exercise protocols and 70 exercise measures in a total of 1,461 participants. Furthermore, the total dose of beta-alanine that participants consumed ranged from 84 to 414 g in studies lasting 28–90 days.\nBeta-alanine supplementation appears to be safe at 1.6–6.4 g/day for up to 8 weeks [ 54 ]. Some evidence does show, however, that consuming a conventional dose of beta-alanine of at least 800 mg or exceeding 10 mg/kg body mass can provoke moderate to severe paresthesia [ 54 , 59 ]. This tingling, prickling, or burning sensation is common in the face, neck, back of the hands, and upper trunk and typically lasts 60–90 minutes but is not a painful, serious, or harmful reaction. Use of divided doses or a sustained-release form of the supplement can attenuate paresthesia resulting from beta-alanine consumption [ 52 , 54 ]. Some research has also found that beta-alanine supplements can produce pruritus (itchy skin), but the authors do not indicate the severity of this effect [ 59 ]. There are no safety data on use of the supplement for more than 1 year [ 54 , 60 ].\nThere is insufficient expert consensus on the value of taking beta-alanine to enhance performance in intense, short-term activities or its safety, particularly when users take it regularly for at least several months. In a position statement, the AND, DoC, and ACSM advise that beta-alanine supplementation might improve training capacity and does enhance performance, especially of high-intensity exercise lasting 60–240 seconds, that acid-base disturbances resulting from increased anaerobic glycolysis would otherwise impair [ 12 ]. In its position statement, the ISSN concludes that beta-alanine supplementation improves exercise performance and attenuates neuromuscular fatigue [ 54 ]. The Australian Institute of Sport supports the use of beta-alanine for improving sports performance in suitable athletic competitions under the direction of an expert in sports medicine, but it notes that more research might be required to understand how the supplement should be used for best results [ 29 ].\nFor healthy individuals willing to use beta-alanine supplements, the ISSN recommends a daily loading dose of 4 to 6 g/day in divided doses of 2 g or less for at least 2 weeks. The society states that benefits increase after 4 weeks, when muscle carnosine concentrations rise by 40%–60% [ 54 ]. It advises users to take beta-alanine supplements with meals to augment muscle carnosine levels and to use divided lower doses or take a sustained-release form if paresthesia occurs.\n",
    "Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate": "HMB is a metabolite of the branched-chain amino acid leucine. About 5% of the body’s leucine is converted into HMB, which is then converted in the liver to a precursor (known as beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) needed for cholesterol biosynthesis [ 61 ]. Some experts hypothesize that skeletal muscle cells that become stressed and damaged from exercise require an exogenous source of the coenzyme for synthesis of cholesterol in their cellular membranes to restore structure and function [ 62 , 63 ]. Experts also believe that the conversion of leucine to HMB activates muscle protein synthesis and reduces protein breakdown [ 63 ]. Supplementation is the only practical way to obtain 3 g/day HMB because one would otherwise need to consume more than 600 g/day of high-quality protein (from 5 lb of beef tenderloin, for example) to obtain enough leucine (60 g) for conversion into HMB [ 63 ].\nAlthough studies have investigated HMB for two decades, they have used substantially different periods of supplementation (1 day to 6 weeks) and daily doses (1.5 to 6 g; most commonly 3 g based on evidence that this dose provides equivalent results to 6 g and better results than 1.5 g) [ 61 , 63 , 64 ]. Studies also used participants of different ages (19 to 50 years), training status (e.g., untrained or trained athletes), training protocols (e.g., with machines or free weights), training duration (10 days to 12 weeks), consumption of other supplements (such as creatine), and other factors. It is therefore difficult to predict what, if any, benefits an exercising individual might experience from consuming HMB.\nThere is general agreement that HMB helps speed up recovery from exercise of sufficient amount and intensity to induce skeletal muscle damage [ 63 , 65 ]. Therefore, trained athletes must exert themselves more than untrained individuals to potentially benefit from using the supplement. Some studies suggest that HMB use has additional benefits, including an ability to enhance strength, power, skeletal muscle hypertrophy, and aerobic performance in both trained and untrained people [ 63 ].\nA review of safety data from nine studies found that users tolerate HMB well, and it is safe at daily intakes of 3 g for 3 to 8 weeks in younger (ages 18–47 years) and older (ages 62–81) adults of both sexes who do or do not exercise [ 66 ]. Assessments of blood chemistry, hematology, and emotional affect found no adverse effects. Another study randomized 37 untrained males age 18–29 years participating in a resistance training program to take either no HMB or about 3–6 g/day HMB [ 62 ]. Use of HMB did not alter or adversely affect any measured hematologic, hepatic, or renal-function parameters in these young men. Although 3 g/day HMB appears to be safe for short-term use in adults, its safety profile (and efficacy) has not been studied in adolescents [ 63 ].\nThere is no expert consensus on the value of taking HMB for several months or longer or its safety. HMB is not on a list of evidence-based ergogenic aids issued by the AND, DoC, and the ACSM [ 12 ]. The Australian Institute of Sport does not recommend HMB supplementation by athletes, except as part of a research protocol or with proper monitoring [ 29 ]. However, the ISSN notes that HMB can enhance recovery by reducing exercise-induced skeletal muscle damage in both trained and untrained individuals [ 63 ].\nHMB is available in two forms: as a mono-hydrated calcium salt (HMB-Ca) and a calcium-free form (HMB-free acid [HMB-FA]). HMB-Ca is approximately 13% calcium by weight, and a daily dose of 3 g/day adds about 400 mg calcium to the diet [ 66 ]. Those who wish to limit their calcium intake can use HMB-FA [ 63 ]. Although the latter form appears to have a faster and greater effect based on its ability to raise HMB plasma levels, more studies are needed to compare the effects of HMB-Ca with those of HMB-FA [ 63 ].\nThe ISSN recommends that healthy adults interested in using HMB supplements take 1–2 g HMB-Ca 60 to 120 minutes before exercise or 1–2 g HMB-FA 30 to 60 minutes before exercise [ 63 ]. It also suggests that supplement users ideally consume 3 g/day HMB (in three equal servings of 1 g) for at least 2 weeks before high-intensity exercise to optimize HMB’s protective effects on muscle.\n",
    "Betaine": "Betaine, also known as trimethylglycine, is found in foods such as beets, spinach, and whole-grain breads. Average daily intakes of betaine range from 100 to 300 mg/day [ 67 ]. The mechanisms by which betaine might enhance exercise and athletic performance are not known, but many are hypothesized. For example, betaine might increase the biosynthesis of creatine, levels of blood nitric acid, and/or the water retention of cells [ 68 ].\nA limited number of small studies in men have assessed betaine in supplemental form as a potential ergogenic aid. These studies, which typically examined strength- and power-based performance in bodybuilders and, occasionally, cyclists, provided conflicting results, and performance improvements tended to be modest [ 68-71 ]. The typical dose of betaine that studies used ranged from 2 to 5 g/day [ 71 ] for up to 15 days.\nThe several small studies of athletes described in the previous paragraph who took betaine supplements for up to several weeks found no side effects or safety concerns. However, research has not adequately evaluated the safety of betaine.\nMore research on betaine supplementation to enhance various types of performance, training protocols, and exercise during specific sports is needed before any recommendations for its use can be made [ 71 ].\n",
    "Branched-chain amino acids": "Three essential amino acids (EAAs)—leucine, isoleucine, and valine—are the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), whose name reflects their chemical structure. BCAAs make up approximately 25% of the amino acids in foods containing complete proteins (including all EAAs) [ 72 ]; most of these foods are animal products, such as meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and milk (see section on protein ). BCAAs comprise about 14%–18% of the amino acids in human skeletal muscle proteins [ 73 ]. Unlike other EAAs, the BCAAs can be metabolized by mitochondria in skeletal muscle to provide energy during exercise [ 74 , 75 ]. The BCAAs, especially leucine, might also stimulate protein synthesis in exercised muscle [ 72 , 76 ].\nThe limited research on the potential ergogenic effects of the BCAAs has found little evidence to date that supplements of these amino acids improve performance in endurance-related aerobic events [ 75 ]. The BCAAs might delay feelings of fatigue or help maintain mental focus by competing with the amino acid tryptophan (a precursor of the neurotransmitter serotonin that regulates mood and sleep) for entry into the brain, but this effect has not been well studied [ 72 , 74 , 75 ]. The results of several short-term studies lasting about 3 to 6 weeks suggest that about 10–14 g/day supplemental BCAAs might enhance gains in muscle mass and strength during training [ 1 ]. Overall, however, studies to date provide inconsistent evidence of the ability of BCAAs to stimulate muscle protein synthesis beyond the capacity of sufficient dietary amounts of any high-quality protein to perform this function [ 76 ]. Furthermore, it is not clear from existing research whether consumption of protein and BCAAs before versus after a workout affects their ability to maximize muscle protein synthesis and reduce protein catabolism [ 12 , 77-79 ].\nUp to 20 g/day BCAA supplements in divided doses appear to be safe [ 75 ]. For leucine alone, studies suggest an upper safe limit of intake of 500 mg/kg per day in healthy young and elderly men, or about 38 g/day for a man weighing 75 kg (165 lb) [ 80-82 ].\nStudies have not consistently shown that taking supplements of BCAAs or any of their three constituent amino acids singly enhances exercise and athletic performance, builds muscle mass, or aids in recovery from exercise. Consuming animal foods containing complete proteins—or a combination of plant-based foods with complementary proteins that together provide all EAAs—automatically increases consumption of BCAAs (see section on protein ). This is also true of consuming protein powders made from complete proteins, especially whey, which has more leucine than either casein or soy [ 78 ].\n",
    "Caffeine": "Caffeine is a methylated xanthine naturally found in variable amounts in coffee; tea; cacao pods (the source of chocolate); and other herbal/botanical sources, such as guarana, kola (or cola) nut, and yerba mate. Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system, muscles, and other organs such as the heart by binding to adenosine receptors on cells, thereby blocking the activity of adenosine, a neuromodulator with sedative-like properties [ 83 , 84 ]. In this way, caffeine enhances arousal, increases vigor, and reduces fatigue [ 13 , 85 , 86 ]. Caffeine also appears to reduce perceived pain and exertion [ 13 , 85 ]. During the early stages of endurance exercise, caffeine might mobilize free fatty acids as a source of energy and spare muscle glycogen [ 38 ].\nCaffeine is commonly used in energy drinks and shots touted for their performance-enhancement effects [ 87 , 88 ]. It is also found in energy gels containing carbohydrates and electrolytes as well as in anhydrous caffeine-only pills.\nMany studies have shown that caffeine might enhance performance in athletes when they ingest about 2–6 mg/kg body weight before exercise by improving endurance, strength, and power in high-intensity team sports activities [ 13 , 85 , 89 , 90 ]. For an individual weighing 154 pounds (70 kg), this dose is equivalent to 210–420 mg caffeine. Taking more, however, is unlikely to improve performance further and increases the risk of side effects.\nA review of the literature found that caffeine intake affected sport-specific performance (e.g., running, cycling, swimming, and rowing), as measured in time trials. Although 30 of the 33 trials showed positive improvements in performance, the improvements were not statistically significant in half of them [ 85 ]. In these studies, performance improvement ranged from a decrease of 0.7% to an increase of 17.3%, suggesting that the caffeine was very helpful to some participants but slightly impaired performance in others. Factors such as the timing of ingestion, caffeine intake mode or form, and habituation to caffeine could also have accounted for the varied effects on performance.\nCaffeine supplementation is more likely to help with endurance-type activities (such as running) and activities of long duration with intermittent activity (such as soccer) than more anaerobic, short-term bouts of intense exercise (such as sprinting or lifting weights) [ 91 ]. Some evidence suggests that caffeine is more likely to improve performance in people who are not habituated to it [ 85 ]. Limiting caffeine intake to 50 mg/day or abstaining from caffeine for 2–7 days before taking it for an athletic event might maximize any ergogenic effect. However, other evidence shows no habituation effect of caffeine consumption on performance [ 92 ].\nHeavy caffeine use (500 mg/day or more) might diminish rather than enhance physical performance and could also disturb sleep and cause irritability and anxiety [ 93 ]. Other adverse effects of caffeine include insomnia, restlessness, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, and arrhythmia [ 94-97 ]. Caffeine does not induce diuresis or increase sweat loss during exercise and therefore does not reduce fluid balance in the body that would adversely affect performance [ 13 , 90 , 98 ].\nFor healthy adults, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) states that 400 mg/day caffeine does not usually have dangerous adverse effects [ 99 ]. The American Medical Association recommends that adults limit their intake of caffeine to 500 mg/day and that adolescents consume no more than 100 mg/day [ 100 ]. The American Academy of Pediatrics warns that caffeine-containing energy drinks in particular have no place in the diets of children or adolescents and are not suitable for use during routine physical activity [ 101 ].\nPure powdered caffeine is available as a dietary supplement and is very potent. A single tablespoon contains 10 g caffeine, and an acute oral dose of 10 to 14 g caffeine (approximately 150–200 mg/kg) can be fatal [ 91 ]. Furthermore, combining caffeine with other stimulants could increase the potential for adverse effects [ 94 ]. At least two young men have died as a result of taking an unknown amount of pure powdered caffeine [ 102 ].\nCaffeine is easily and rapidly absorbed, even from the buccal membranes in the mouth, and is distributed throughout the body and brain. It reaches peak concentrations in the blood within 45 minutes of consumption and has a half-life of about 4–5 hours [ 83 ]. For a potential benefit to athletic performance, users should consume caffeine 15 to 60 minutes before exercise [ 13 , 85 ]. Consumption of caffeine with fluid during exercise of long duration might extend any performance improvements [ 85 ].\nIn a position statement, the AND, DoC, and ACSM state that caffeine supplementation reduces perceived fatigue and enables users to sustain exercise at the desired intensity longer [ 12 ]. The U.S. Department of Defense states that caffeine supplementation at 2–6 mg/kg body weight is linked to enhanced physical performance and the effects of smaller doses usually last longer and are greater in people who do not usually consume caffeine [ 89 ]. It adds that caffeine could reduce perceived exertion when exercise lasts longer. In a position statement, the ISSN describes caffeine as effective in trained athletes for improving sports performance and notes that supplementation with about 3–6 mg/kg has an ergogenic effect on sustained maximal endurance exercise but not necessarily on strength-power performance [ 13 ]. The Australian Institute of Sport supports the use of caffeine for improving sports performance in suitable athletic competitions under the direction of an expert in sports medicine, but it notes that more research might be required to understand how caffeine should be used for best results [ 29 ].\nThe International Olympic Committee considers caffeine to be a controlled or restricted substance; Olympic athletes may consume it until urinary concentrations exceed 12 mcg/ml [ 103 ]. The National Collegiate Athletic Association prohibits use of caffeine from any source in amounts that would lead to urine concentrations exceeding 15 mcg/ml [ 104 , 105 ]. (Consuming about 500 mg caffeine produces a urinary caffeine concentration of 15 mcg/ml within 2–3 hours [ 106 ].) The World Anti-Doping Agency does not prohibit or limit caffeine use [ 107 ].\n",
    "Citrulline": "L-citrulline is a nonessential amino acid produced in the body, mainly from glutamine, and obtained from the diet. Watermelon is the best-known source; 1 cup diced seedless watermelon has about 365 mg citrulline [ 108 ]. About 80% of the body's citrulline is converted in the kidneys into arginine, another amino acid (see section on arginine ) [ 30 ]. The subsequent conversion of arginine to nitric oxide, a potent dilator of blood vessels, might be the mechanism by which citrulline could serve as an ergogenic aid. In fact, consumption of citrulline might be a more efficient way to raise blood arginine levels than consumption of arginine because more citrulline is absorbed from the gut than arginine.\nMost studies have used citrulline malate, a combination of citrulline with malic acid (a constituent in many fruits that is also produced endogenously), because malate, an intermediate in the Krebs cycle, might enhance energy production [ 30 ].\nThe research to support supplemental citrulline as an ergogenic aid is limited and conflicting at best. The few published studies have had heterogeneous designs and ranged in duration from 1 to 16 days. As an example, in one randomized controlled study with a crossover design, 41 healthy male weightlifters age 22–37 years consumed 8 g citrulline malate or a placebo 1 hour before completing barbell bench presses to exhaustion [ 109 ]. Overall, participants could complete significantly more repetitions when taking the supplement and reported significantly less muscle soreness 1 and 2 days after the test. Another study that randomized 17 young healthy men and women to take citrulline without malate (either 3 g before testing or 9 g over 24 hours) or a placebo found that participants using the citrulline did not perform as well as those taking the placebo on an incremental treadmill test to exhaustion [ 110 ]. Although citrulline supplementation might increase plasma levels of nitric oxide metabolites, such a response has not been directly related to any improvement in athletic performance [ 30 ].\nStudies have not adequately assessed the safety of citrulline, particularly when users take it in supplemental form for months at a time. In the study of weight lifters described above, 6 of the 41 participants reported stomach discomfort after taking the supplement [ 109 ]. Additional short-term studies in which supplemental citrulline was provided to nonathletes at up to 6 g/day for 4 weeks and 1.35 g/day for 6 weeks found no adverse effects [ 111 ].\nThe research to date does not provide strong support for taking citrulline or citrulline malate to enhance exercise or athletic performance [ 30 ]. Whether athletes in specific sports or activities might benefit from taking supplemental citrulline remains to be determined [ 109 ].\nDietary supplements that contain citrulline provide either citrulline or citrulline malate. Citrulline malate is 56.64% citrulline by weight so, for example, 1 g citrulline malate provides 566 mg of citrulline. Sellers of some citrulline malate dietary supplements claim that they provide a higher percentage of citrulline (with labels listing, for example, citrulline malate 2:1 or tri-citrulline malate), but studies have not determined whether these supplements are superior to standard citrulline or citrulline malate supplements.\n",
    "Creatine": "Creatine is one of the most thoroughly studied and widely used dietary supplements to enhance exercise and sports performance [ 112 ]. Creatine is produced endogenously and obtained from the diet in small amounts. It helps generate ATP and thereby supplies the muscles with energy, particularly for short-term events [ 113 ]. Creatine might improve muscle performance in four ways: by increasing stores of phosphocreatine used to generate ATP at the beginning of intense exercise, accelerating the re-synthesis of phosphocreatine after exercise, depressing the degradation of adenine nucleotides and the accumulation of lactate, and/or enhancing glycogen storage in skeletal muscles [ 113 ].\nThe liver and kidneys synthesize about 1 g/day creatine from the amino acids glycine, arginine, and methionine [ 114 ]. Animal-based foods, such as beef (2 g/lb), pork (2.3 g/lb), and salmon (2 g/lb), also contain creatine. A person weighing 154 pounds has about 120 g creatine and phosphocreatine in his or her body, almost all in the skeletal and cardiac muscles [ 112 ]. However, it is only when users consume much greater amounts of creatine over time as a dietary supplement that it could have ergogenic effects. Metabolized creatine is converted into the waste product creatinine, which is eliminated from the body through the kidneys.\nStudies in both laboratory and sports settings have found that short-term creatine supplementation (for 5 to 7 days) in both men and women often significantly increases strength (e.g., for bench presses) and power (e.g., for cycling), work involving multiple sets of maximal effort muscle contractions, and sprinting and soccer performance [ 112 , 115 ]. In one example, a study randomized 14 healthy, resistance-trained men (age 19–29 years) to receive 25 g creatine monohydrate or a placebo for 6–7 days [ 116 ]. Participants taking the supplement had significant improvements in peak power output during all five sets of jump squats and in repetitions during all five sets of bench presses on three occasions. In another study, 18 well-trained male sprinters age 18–24 years received either 20 g/day creatine or a placebo for 5 days [ 117 ]. Compared with those taking the placebo, participants taking the creatine improved their performance in both 100-meter sprints and six intermittent 60-m sprints.\nSupplementation with creatine over weeks or months helps training adaptations to structured, increased workloads over time. For example, in a randomized study of 14 female collegiate soccer players during the off-season, those who received creatine (15 g/day for 1 week and then 5 g/day for 12 weeks) had significantly greater increases in muscle strength, as measured by bench press and full-squat maximal strength testing, but not lean tissue compared with participants who took a placebo [ 118 ].\nIndividuals have varied responses to creatine supplementation, based on factors such as diet and the relative percentages of various muscle fiber types [ 114 , 119 ]. Vegetarians, for example, with their lower muscle creatine content, might have greater responses to supplementation than meat eaters. Overall, creatine enhances performance during repeated short bursts of high-intensity, intermittent activity, such as sprinting and weight lifting, where energy for this predominantly anaerobic exercise comes mainly from the ATP-creatine phosphate energy system [ 38 , 114 ].\nCreatine supplementation seems to be of little value for endurance sports, such as distance running or swimming, that do not depend on the short-term ATP-creatine phosphate system to provide short-term energy, and it leads to weight gain that might impede performance in such sports [ 113 , 114 ]. Furthermore, in predominantly aerobic exercise lasting more than 150 seconds, the body relies on oxidative phosphorylation as the primary energy source, a metabolic pathway that does not require creatine [ 114 ].\nStudies have found no consistent set of side effects from creatine use, except that it often leads to weight gain, because it increases water retention and possibly stimulates muscle protein synthesis [ 112 , 113 ]. Several studies have found that supplemental creatine monohydrate, when used for a strength-training program, can lead to a 1–2 kg increase in total body weight in a month [ 73 ].\nCreatine is considered safe for short-term use by healthy adults [ 12 , 112 , 113 , 114 ]. In addition, evidence shows that use of the product for several years is safe [ 112 , 120-122 ]. Anecdotal reactions to creatine use include nausea, diarrhea and related gastrointestinal distress, muscle cramps, and heat intolerance. Creatine supplementation may reduce the range of motion of various parts of the body (such as the shoulders, ankles, and lower legs) and lead to muscle stiffness and resistance to stretching [ 114 ]. Adequate hydration while taking creatine might minimize these uncommon risks [ 113 ].\nIn a position statement, the AND, DoC, and ACSM advise that creatine enhances performance of cycles of high-intensity exercise followed by short recovery periods and improves training capacity [ 12 ]. In its position statement, the ISSN states that creatine monohydrate is the most effective nutritional supplement currently available for enhancing capacity for high-intensity exercise and lean body mass during exercise [ 112 ]. The ISSN contends that athletes who supplement with creatine have a lower incidence of injuries and exercise-related side effects compared to those who do not take creatine [ 112 ]. The Australian Institute of Sport supports the use of creatine for improving sports performance in suitable athletic competitions under the direction of an expert in sports medicine, but it notes that more research might be required to understand how the supplement should be used for best results [ 29 ].\nA typical protocol for creatine supplementation in adults, regardless of sex or body size, consists of a loading phase for 5–7 days, when users consume 20 g/day creatine monohydrate in four portions of 5 g, followed by a maintenance phase of 3–5 g/day [ 112-114 ]. In some studies, the loading dose is based on body weight (e.g., 0.3 g/kg) [ 114 ]. Another creatine supplementation protocol consists of taking single doses of about 3–6 g/day (0.03–0.1 g/kg body weight) for 3 to 4 weeks, without a loading phase, to produce ergogenic effects [ 112 , 114 , 119 ].\nCreatine monohydrate, which is 88% creatine by weight, is the most widely used and studied form [ 112 , 114 , 123 ]. Other, usually more expensive, forms of creatine (e.g., creatine ethyl ester, creatine alpha-ketoglutarate, and buffered forms of creatine) have not been proven to have superior ability to creatine monohydrate for enhancing muscle creatine levels, digestibility, product stability, or safety [ 73 , 112 , 123 ].\n",
    "Deer antler velvet": "Deer antler velvet consists of cartilage and epidermis from growing deer or elk antlers before ossification [ 124 , 125 ]. It is used as a general health aid in traditional Chinese medicine. Several growth factors have been detected in deer antler velvet, such as IGF-1, that could promote muscle tissue growth in a similar way to the quick growth of deer antlers.\nThree randomized controlled trials in a total of 95 young and middle-age men and 21 young females provide virtually no evidence that deer antler velvet supplements improve aerobic or anaerobic performance, muscular strength, or endurance [ 125 , 126 ]. One of the trials randomized 38 active men age 19–24 years to take 300 mg/d of a deer-antler-velvet extract, 1.5 g/d of a deer-antler-velvet powder, or a placebo and begin a strength- and endurance-training program [ 126 ]. The supplements provided no significant ergogenic effects compared with placebo.\nStudies have not adequately assessed the safety of deer antler velvet. The studies cited above found no side effects in participants taking deer-antler-velvet supplements. IGF-1 is available as a prescription medication, and its reported side effects include hypoglycemia, headache, edema, and joint pain [ 127 ]. An evaluation of six deer-antler-velvet dietary supplements that were commercially available in 2013 found that five of them contained no deer IGF-1, and four were adulterated with human IGF-1 [ 124 ]. Only one of the six supplements contained a low level of deer IGF-1.\nThe research to date does not support taking deer-antler-velvet supplements to enhance exercise or athletic performance. The National Collegiate Athletic Association [ 105 ] and the World Anti-Doping Agency [ 128 ] ban the use of IGF-1 and its analogues in athletic competition.\n",
    "Dehydroepiandrosterone": "DHEA is a steroid hormone secreted by the adrenal cortex. The body can convert DHEA to the male hormone testosterone; testosterone's intermediary, androstenedione; and the female hormone estradiol [ 129 ]. Testosterone is an anabolic steroid that promotes gains in muscle mass and strength when combined with resistance training [ 130 ].\nThe minimal research on DHEA's use to enhance exercise and athletic performance provides no evidence of benefit [ 129 ]. One study, for example, randomly assigned 40 male weightlifters (average age 48 years) to receive DHEA (100 mg/day), androstenedione (100 mg/day), or a placebo for 12 weeks while continuing their training programs. Compared to placebo, the DHEA and androstenedione produced no statistically significant increase in strength, aerobic capacity, lean body mass, or testosterone levels [ 131 ]. Another study randomly assigned 20 sedentary men 19–29 years of age to receive either 150 mg/day DHEA or a placebo for 6 of 8 weeks in combination with a resistance-training program. The supplement provided no benefits compared with placebo in increasing muscle strength, lean body mass, or testosterone concentrations [ 130 ].\nStudies have not adequately assessed the safety of DHEA. The two short-term studies in men described above found no side effects from the DHEA; blood lipid levels and liver function remained normal. Other studies have found that in women, use of DHEA for months significantly raises serum testosterone but not estrogen levels, which can cause acne and growth of facial hair [ 129 ].\nThe research to date does not support taking DHEA supplements to enhance exercise or athletic performance. The National Collegiate Athletic Association and the World Anti-Doping Agency ban the use of DHEA [ 105 , 128 ].\n",
    "Ginseng": "Ginseng is a generic term for botanicals from the genus Panax . Some popular varieties are known as Chinese, Korean, American, and Japanese ginseng. Preparations made from ginseng roots have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for millennia as a tonic to improve stamina and vitality [ 132 ]. So-called Siberian or Russian ginseng ( Eleutherococcus senticosus ), although unrelated to Panax ginseng, has also been used in traditional Chinese medicine to combat fatigue and strengthen the immune system [ 133 ].\nNumerous small studies, with and without placebo controls, have investigated Panax ginseng's potential to improve the physical performance of athletes, regular and occasional exercisers, and largely sedentary individuals. In almost all cases, the studies found that Panax ginseng in various doses and preparations had no ergogenic effect on such measures as peak power output, time to exhaustion, perceived exertion, recovery from intense activity, oxygen consumption, or heart rate [ 132 , 134-136 ].\nOne review of studies of the effects of Siberian ginseng on endurance performance found that the five studies with the most rigorous research protocols (with a total of 55 men and 24 women) showed no effect of supplementation for up to 6 weeks on exercise performed for up to 120 minutes [ 133 ]. A subsequent randomized controlled trial using a crossover design with nine male college tennis players found that 800 mg/day Siberian ginseng (prepared from the root and rhizome) for 8 weeks significantly improved endurance in a cycling trial, elevated VO 2 max and heart rate, and increased fat oxidation [ 137 ].\nShort-term Panax ginseng use appears to be safe; the most commonly reported adverse effects include headache, sleep disturbances, and gastrointestinal disorders [ 136 ]. Short-term Siberian ginseng use also appears to be safe. The studies cited above reported no adverse effects, although other reports of clinical trials have listed insomnia as a rare side effect [ 138 ].\nThe research to date provides little support for taking ginseng to enhance exercise or athletic performance [ 132 , 136 ].\n",
    "Glutamine": "Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in muscle, blood, and the body’s free-amino-acid pool. It is synthesized in the body primarily from the BCAAs, and an adult consumes about 3–6 g/day in protein-containing foods [ 139 , 140 ]. Glutamine is a key molecule in metabolism and energy production, and it contributes nitrogen for many critical biochemical reactions [ 141 ]. It is an EAA for critically ill patients when the body's need for glutamine exceeds its capacity to produce sufficient amounts.\nFew studies have examined the effect of glutamine supplementation alone as an ergogenic aid [ 142 ]. One study randomized 31 male and female weightlifters to receive either glutamine (0.9 g/kg lean body mass, or almost 45 g/day) or placebo while completing a 6-week strength-training program. There were no significant differences between the two groups in measures of strength, torque, or lean tissue mass, demonstrating that glutamine had no effect on muscle performance, body composition, or muscle-protein degradation. Another study compared the effect of glutamine (four doses of 0.3 g/kg body weight over 3 days) or placebo in 16 young adult men and women on recovery from eccentric exercise consisting of unilateral knee extensions [ 143 ]. Supplementation with glutamine reduced the magnitude of strength loss, accelerated strength recovery, and diminished muscle soreness more quickly than placebo; these effects were more pronounced in the men. Some athletes use glutamine supplements in the hope that they will attenuate exercise-induced immune impairment and reduce their risk of developing upper respiratory tract infections. However, there is little research-based support for this benefit [ 140 , 141 ].\nIn the studies described above, the glutamine had no reported side effects. Many patients with serious catabolic illnesses, such as infections, intestinal diseases, and burns, take glutamine safely as part of their medical care. Daily oral doses ranging from 0.21 to 0.42 g/kg body weight glutamine (equivalent to 15–30 g/day in a person weighing 154 pounds) have provided no biochemical or clinical evidence of toxicity [ 139 ].\nThe research to date does not support taking glutamine alone to improve exercise and athletic performance [ 139 , 140 ].\n",
    "Iron": "Iron is an essential mineral and a structural component of hemoglobin, an erythrocyte protein that transfers oxygen from the lungs to the tissues, and myoglobin, a protein in muscles that provides them with oxygen. Iron is also necessary to metabolize substrates for energy as a component of cytochromes and to dehydrogenase enzymes involved in substrate oxidation [ 144 ]. Iron deficiency impairs oxygen-carrying capacity and muscle function, and it limits people's ability to exercise and be active [ 12 , 145 ]. Its detrimental effects can include fatigue and lethargy, lower aerobic capacity, and slower times in performance trials [ 146 ].\nIron balance is an important consideration for athletes who must pay attention to both iron intakes and iron losses. Teenage girls and premenopausal women are at increased risk of obtaining insufficient amounts of iron from their diets. They require more iron than teenage boys and men because they lose considerable iron due to menstruation, and they might not eat sufficient amounts of iron-containing foods [ 147 , 148 ].\nAthletes of both sexes lose additional iron for several reasons [ 145 , 146 , 149 , 150 ]. Physical activity produces acute inflammation that reduces iron absorption from the gut and iron use via a peptide, hepcidin, that regulates iron homeostasis. Iron is also lost in sweat. The destruction of erythrocytes in the feet because of frequent striking on hard surfaces leads to foot-strike hemolysis. Also, use of anti-inflammatories and pain medications can lead to some blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract, thereby decreasing iron stores.\nThe richest dietary sources of heme iron (which is highly bioavailable) include lean meats and seafood. Plant-based foods—such as nuts, beans, vegetables, and fortified grain products—contain nonheme iron, which is less bioavailable than heme iron.\nAlthough iron deficiency anemia decreases work capacity, there is conflicting evidence on whether milder iron deficiency without anemia impairs sport and exercise performance [ 12 , 151 , 152 ]. One systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether iron treatments (provided orally or by injection) improved iron status and aerobic capacity in iron-deficient but nonanemic endurance athletes identified 19 studies involving 80 men and 363 women with a mean age of 22 years. Iron treatments improved iron status as expected, but they did not guarantee improvement in aerobic capacity or indices of endurance performance [ 153 ]. Another systematic review and meta-analysis compared the effects of iron supplementation with no supplementation on exercise performance in women of reproductive age [ 149 ]. Most of the 24 studies identified were small (i.e., they randomly assigned fewer than 20 women to a treatment or control group) and had a risk of bias. Based on the limited data and heterogenicity of results, the study authors suggested that preventing and treating iron deficiency could improve the performance of female athletes in sports that require endurance, maximal power output, and strength.\nAthletes can safely obtain recommended intakes of iron by consuming a healthy diet containing iron-rich foods and by taking an iron-containing dietary supplement as needed. High doses of iron may be prescribed for several weeks or months to treat iron deficiency, especially if anemia is present.\nThe UL for iron is 45 mg/day for men and women age 14 and older and 40 mg/day for younger children [ 147 ]. Acute intakes of more than 20 mg/kg iron from supplements or medicines can lead to gastric upset, constipation, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and fainting, especially if users do not consume food at the same time [ 147 , 150 ]. Individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis, which predisposes them to absorb excessive amounts of dietary and supplemental iron, have an increased risk of iron overload [ 154 ].\nCorrecting iron deficiency anemia improves work capacity, but there is conflicting evidence on whether milder iron deficiency without anemia impairs athletic performance. In a position statement, the AND, DoC, and ACSM do not recommend routine supplementation of iron except in response to a health care provider’s instruction and note that such supplementation is only ergogenic if the individual has iron depletion [ 12 ]. Furthermore, they warn that iron supplementation can cause gastrointestinal side effects.\nThe recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for iron is 11 mg for teenage boys and 15 mg for teenage girls [ 147 ]. The RDA is 8 mg for men and 18 mg for women age 50 and younger, and 8 mg for older adults of both sexes. Individuals who engage in intense exercise might require 30% to 70% more iron than moderately active and sedentary people [ 147 ]. Recommended intakes of iron for vegetarians and vegans are 1.8 times higher than for people who eat meat [ 147 ].\nMore information on iron and the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia is available in the ODS health professional fact sheet on iron .\n",
    "Protein": "Protein is necessary to build, maintain, and repair muscle. Exercise increases intramuscular protein oxidation and breakdown, after which muscle-protein synthesis increases for up to a day or two [ 155 ]. Regular resistance exercise results in the accretion of myofibrillar protein (the predominant proteins in skeletal muscle) and an increase in skeletal muscle fiber size. Aerobic exercise leads to more modest protein accumulation in working muscle, primarily in the mitochondria, which enhances oxidative capacity (oxygen use) for future workouts [ 155 , 156 ].\nAthletes must consider both protein quality and quantity to meet their needs for the nutrient. They must obtain EAAs from the diet or from supplementation to support muscle growth, maintenance, and repair [ 155 ]. The nine EAAs are histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. Most complete proteins (those that contain all EAAs) are composed of about 40% EAAs, so a meal or snack with 25 g total protein provides about 10 g EAAs.\nSee other sections of this fact sheet for information on the amino acids arginine and glutamine as well as the BCAAs (leucine, isoleucine, and valine). The potential of these amino acids to enhance exercise and athletic performance is not related to their incorporation into proteins.\nAdequate protein in the diet is required to provide the EAAs necessary for muscle-protein synthesis and to minimize muscle-protein breakdown. Dietary protein consumption increases the concentration of amino acids in the blood, which muscle cells then take up. Sufficient protein is necessary primarily to optimize the training response to, and the recovery period after, exercise [ 12 , 157 ].\nMuscle protein synthesis leading to increases in strength and muscle mass appears to be optimal with the consumption of high-quality protein (providing about 10 g EAAs) within 0–2 hours after exercise, in the early recovery phase [ 12 ]. However, a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials found that ingesting protein within an hour before or after exercise does not significantly increase muscle strength or size or facilitate muscle repair or remodeling [ 77 ]. The period after exercise when protein intake reduces muscle protein breakdown, builds muscle, and increases mitochondrial proteins to enhance oxygen use by working muscles (the so-called window of anabolic opportunity) can last for up to 24 hours [ 79 ].\nSeveral studies in people engaged in resistance training show that consuming some protein before sleep can increase the rate of protein synthesis during the night and/or augment muscle mass and strength [ 79 , 158 , 159 ]. Participants in these studies consumed a bedtime drink containing 27.5 or 40 g of the milk protein casein, which increased circulating amino acid levels throughout the night. Some studies show increased muscle protein synthesis when plasma levels of amino acids are raised [ 76 ].\nThe Food and Nutrition Board has not set a UL for protein, noting that the risk of adverse effects from excess protein from food is very low [ 160 ]. However, it advises caution for those obtaining high protein intakes from foods and supplements because of the limited data on their potential adverse effects. High-protein diets (e.g., those providing two to three times the RDA of 0.8 g/kg/day for healthy adults and 0.85 g/kg/day for adolescents) do not appear to increase the risk of renal stones or dehydration; compromise renal function; reduce bone health; or, when consumed for several months, alter glomerular filtration rate or blood levels of lipids, glucose, creatine, or blood urea nitrogen [ 160-164 ]. Protein increases urinary calcium excretion, but this appears to have no consequence for long-term bone health [ 165 ] and, in any event, is easily compensated for by the consumption of slightly more calcium.\nMany foods—including meats, poultry, seafood, eggs, dairy products, beans, and nuts—contain protein. Protein powders and drinks are also available, most of which contain whey, one of the complete proteins isolated from milk [ 166 ]. Digestion of casein, the main complete protein in milk, is slower than that of whey, so the release of amino acids from casein into the blood is slower [ 72 ]. Soy protein lacks the EAA methionine and might lose some cysteine and lysine in processing; rice protein lacks the EAA isoleucine [ 166 ]. Many protein supplements consist of a combination of these protein sources. All EAAs are necessary to stimulate muscle protein synthesis, so users should select singular or complementary protein sources accordingly. To maximize muscle adaptations to training, the AND, DoC, and ACSM recommend that athletes consume 0.3 g/kg body weight of high-quality protein (e.g., about 20 g for a person weighing 150 lb) 0 to 2 hours after exercise and then every 3 to 5 hours [ 12 ].\nSince the Food and Nutrition Board developed the RDA for protein, more recent data have suggested that athletes require a daily protein intake of 1.2 to 2.0 g/kg to support metabolic adaptations, muscle repair and remodeling, and protein turnover [ 12 , 167 ]. Athletes might benefit from even greater amounts for short periods of intense training or when they reduce their energy intake to improve physique or achieve a competition weight [ 12 ]. The 2007–2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) showed that the average daily intake of protein by adult men is 100 g and by women is 69 g [ 168 ]. Athletes who require additional protein can obtain it by consuming more protein-containing foods and, if needed, protein supplements and protein-fortified food and beverage products.\n",
    "Quercetin": "Quercetin is a polyphenolic flavonol that is naturally present in a variety of fruits (such as apples), vegetables (such as onions), and beverages (such as wine and, especially, tea). An analysis of NHANES 1999–2002 data found that estimated daily total flavonol (including quercetin) consumption by adults averaged about 13 mg/day [ 169 ]. The mechanisms by which quercetin might enhance exercise and athletic performance when taken in much larger amounts are not known, but many have been hypothesized. For example, quercetin might increase the number of mitochondria in muscle, reduce oxidative stress, decrease inflammation, and improve endothelial function (blood flow) [ 170 , 171 ].\nNumerous small studies have assessed quercetin in supplemental form as a potential ergogenic aid in young adult, mostly male, participants. These studies typically examined the endurance performance and VO 2 max of participants engaged in aerobic activities, such as running or cycling trials, who received either quercetin (most often 1,000 mg/day) or placebo for 1 to 8 weeks [ 170 , 172-175 ]. The effects of quercetin supplementation were inconsistent and varied by study, but they generally ranged from no ergogenic benefit to only a trivial or small improvement that might not be meaningful in real-world (in contrast to laboratory) exercise conditions [ 42 , 170 , 171 , 176 ].\nThe studies of trained athletes and untrained participants cited in the previous paragraph who took as much as 1,000 mg/day quercetin for up to 2 months found no side effects or safety concerns. The safety of longer term use of that amount of quercetin or more has not been studied. FDA considers up to 500 mg/serving quercetin to be generally recognized as safe (GRAS) as an ingredient in foods such as beverages, processed fruits and fruit juices, grain products, pastas, and soft candies [ 171 , 177 ].\nMore research, including larger clinical trials, on quercetin supplementation to improve aerobic capacity in trained athletes during specific sports and competitions is needed before any recommendations can be made [ 170 ].\n",
    "Ribose": "Ribose, a naturally occurring 5-carbon sugar synthesized by cells and found in some foods, is involved in the production of ATP [ 75 ]. The amount of ATP in muscle is limited, and it must continually be resynthesized. Therefore, theoretically, the more ribose in the body, the more potential ATP production [ 178 ].\nThe limited amount of research on ribose shows little if any benefit of doses ranging from 625 to 10,000 mg/day for up to 8 weeks for exercise capacity in both trained and untrained healthy adults [ 1 , 179 ].\nThe authors of the short-term studies investigating ribose as a potential ergogenic aid have not reported any safety concerns. No studies have assessed the safety of long-term ribose use as a dietary supplement.\nSupplemental ribose does not appear to improve aerobic or anaerobic performance [ 1 , 75 ].\n",
    "Sodium bicarbonate": "Sodium bicarbonate is commonly known as baking soda. The consumption of several teaspoons of sodium bicarbonate over a short time temporarily increases blood pH by acting as a buffering agent. The precise mechanism by which this induced alkalosis leads to an ergogenic response to exercise is unclear. It is thought that bicarbonate loading enhances disposal of hydrogen ions that accumulate and efflux from working muscles as they generate energy in the form of ATP via anaerobic glycolysis from high-intensity exercise, thereby reducing the metabolic acidosis that contributes to fatigue [ 180 , 181 ]. As a result, supplementation with sodium bicarbonate might improve performance in short-term, intense exercises (e.g., sprinting and swimming) and in intermittently intense sports (e.g., boxing and tennis).\nMany studies have assessed sodium bicarbonate as an ergogenic aid in swimmers, cyclists, rowers, boxers, tennis and rugby players, judo practitioners, and others [ 180-182 ]. These studies usually included a small number of participants who underwent one or more trials in a laboratory over several days.\nBecause the research results are conflicting, the activities and individuals most likely to benefit from sodium bicarbonate supplementation in real-world conditions is not clear. Reviewers of these studies generally agree that taking about 300 mg/kg body weight sodium bicarbonate might provide a minor to moderate performance benefit in strenuous exercise over several minutes and in sports that involve intermittent, high-intensity activity [ 180-182 ]. However, individuals have varied responses to bicarbonate loading; the practice does not benefit some users, and it can worsen rather than enhance performance in others. Recreationally active individuals, in particular, might find the supplements to be ergogenic for one exercise session but not another. Many study findings suggest that supplementation with sodium bicarbonate is most likely to improve the performance of trained athletes [ 181 , 182 ].\nThe main side effect of sodium bicarbonate supplementation in gram quantities is gastrointestinal distress, including nausea, stomach pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. Supplement users can reduce or minimize this distress by consuming the total dose in smaller amounts multiple times over an hour with fluid and a snack of carbohydrate-rich food [ 180 , 183 ]. Sodium bicarbonate is 27.4% sodium by weight; 1 teaspoon (4.6 g) contains 1,259 mg sodium. A 70-kg individual ingesting a recommended dose of 300 mg/kg body weight would consume approximately 5,750 mg sodium. Such a large intake of sodium with fluid can lead to temporary hyperhydration, which could be useful in activities where large sweat losses might otherwise lead to significant fluid deficits. However, the slight increase in body weight from fluid retention might hinder performance in other sports [ 180 ]. Studies have not evaluated the safety (and effectiveness) of long-term use of sodium bicarbonate as an ergogenic aid over months or longer.\nThe amount of sodium bicarbonate in recommended servings of dietary supplements—about 300 mg/kg body weight, or the equivalent of 4–5 teaspoons of baking soda for most individuals taken 1–2 hours before exercise in one or multiple doses as a pill or as a powder mixed with a flavored fluid—is generally much less than the quantity that could enhance exercise and athletic performance. Many athletes find this amount of sodium bicarbonate powder dissolved in fluid to be unpalatably salty [ 180 ]. The Australian Institute of Sport supports the use of bicarbonate for improving sports performance in suitable athletic competitions under the direction of an expert in sports medicine, but it notes that more research might be required to understand how the supplement should be used for best results [ 29 ].\n",
    "Tart or sour cherry": "The Montmorency variety of tart or sour cherry ( Prunus cerasus ) contains anthocyanins and other polyphenolic phytochemicals, such as quercetin. Researchers hypothesize that these compounds have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that might facilitate exercise recovery by reducing pain and inflammation, strength loss and muscle damage from intense activity, and hyperventilation trauma from endurance activities [ 184-187 ]. The labels on tart-cherry juice and concentrate products do not usually indicate that they are dietary supplements, although the labels on products containing encapsulated tart-cherry powder do.\nMuch of the limited research on use of tart cherry to enhance exercise and athletic performance involves short-term use of a tart-cherry product or placebo by young resistance-trained men for about a week before a test of strength (such as single-leg extensions or back squats); participants continue taking the supplements for about 2 days after the test. Study results vary, but the benefits appear to include more rapid recovery of strength and/or lower perceived muscle soreness [ 184 , 185 , 188 ]. One pilot study investigated the use of tart-cherry juice (472 ml/day; the equivalent of 100–120 whole cherries) or a placebo for a week before a marathon and 2 days afterward in 13 male and 7 female runners (age range 24–50 years) [ 186 ]. None of the participants who drank the juice experienced airway inflammation causing upper respiratory tract symptoms after the marathon (a common complaint in many marathon runners), but half of those drinking the placebo did. Another study compared a supplement containing 480 mg freeze-dried Montmorency tart-cherry-skin powder (CherryPURE) with a placebo in 18 male and 9 female endurance-trained runners and triathletes (age range 18–26 years) [ 189 ]. Participants took the supplements once a day for 10 days, including the day they ran a half-marathon, then for 2 days after the run. Participants taking the tart-cherry supplement averaged a statistically significant 13% shorter race finish time and had lower levels of blood markers of inflammation and muscle catabolism than the placebo takers, but perceptions of soreness of the quadriceps muscles did not differ significantly between the groups.\nFurther research is needed to determine the value of tart-cherry products for enhancing performance and recovery from intense exercise or participation in sports—especially when used on a regular basis—and the amounts of supplement, juice, or concentrate needed to provide any benefits.\nStudies have not identified any side effects of the fresh tart-cherry juice or concentrate or of supplements of dried tart-cherry-skin powder. However, they have not adequately assessed the safety of tart-cherry dietary supplements.\nThere is no expert consensus on the value of taking tart-cherry products to enhance exercise and athletic performance.\n",
    "Tribulus terrestris": "Tribulus terrestris (common names include bindii, goat's-head, bullhead, and tackweed), is a fruit-bearing plant that is most common in Africa, Asia, Australia, and Europe. It has been used since ancient times in Greece, China, and Asia to treat low libido and infertility [ 190 ]. Tribulus terrestris extracts contain many compounds, including steroidal saponins [ 191 ]. Some marketers claim that Tribulus terrestris enhances exercise and athletic performance by increasing serum concentrations of testosterone and luteinizing hormone, but studies have not adequately determined its potential mechanisms of action [ 192 ].\nOnly a few small, short-term clinical trials have investigated Tribulus terrestris as an ergogenic aid [ 192 ], and none since 2007. In one study, 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg Tribulus terrestris or a placebo taken for 4 weeks by men age 20–36 years did not raise levels of either hormone [ 193 ]. A study in 15 resistance-trained men found no differences among those taking 3.21 mg/kg Tribulus terrestris or placebo for 8 weeks in improvements in bench and leg press scores or in muscle mass [ 194 ]. In 22 elite male rugby players age 19.8 years, on average, who were randomly assigned to take 450 mg/day Tribulus terrestris or a placebo for 5 weeks, the supplement did not have a superior effect on strength or lean body mass [ 192 ].\nThe only toxicity studies of Tribulus terrestris were conducted in animals, where unspecified high intakes led to severe heart, liver, and kidney damage [ 190 ]. The clinical studies described above found no side effects of Tribulus terrestris . One case report involved an Iranian man with severe obesity, age 28, who consumed 2 L/day Tribulus terrestris water for 2 days before being hospitalized with seizures, severe weakness in the legs, malaise, and poor appetite [ 195 ]. Subsequent tests indicated hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and neurotoxicity. The man's condition improved after he discontinued the water, but the water was not tested to determine the presence or amount of Tribulus terrestris or any other potential toxin or contaminant.\nThe Australian Institute of Sport advises against the use of Tribulus terrestris by athletes, noting that this supplement and other claimed testosterone boosters are banned from athletic competitions or have a high risk of being contaminated with substances that, if ingested, could lead to positive drug-screening results [ 196 ].\nThe published biomedical literature provides no support for the efficacy and insufficient support for the safety of Tribulus terrestris for enhancing exercise performance [ 190 ].\n",
    "Ingredients Banned from Dietary Supplements": "This section provides examples of ingredients that FDA currently prohibits in dietary supplements and that some consumers have used in the past as ergogenic aids, despite the lack of evidence supporting their use.\n",
    "Androstenedione": "Androstenedione is an anabolic steroid precursor, or prohormone, that the body converts to testosterone (which induces muscle growth) and estrogen [ 197 ]. Major League Baseball slugger Mark McGwire popularized androstenedione as an ergogenic aid in 1998 [ 198 ]. However, two randomized clinical trials found no performance benefits from androstenedione supplements. In one study, 10 healthy young men (age 19–29 years) took a single 100-mg dose of androstenedione. Another 20 were randomized to receive either 300 mg/day androstenedione or a placebo for 6 of 8 weeks while undergoing resistance-training and muscle-strengthening exercises [ 199 ]. The short-term or longer term use of the supplement did not affect serum testosterone concentrations, nor did it produce any significantly greater gains in resistance-training performance, muscle strength, or lean body mass. However, participants who took androstenedione for the 6 weeks experienced significant declines in their high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and significant increases in serum estrogens. A similar study randomized 50 men (age 35–65 years) to take 200 mg/day androstenedione, 200 mg/day of the related androstenediol, or a placebo for 12 weeks while participating in a high-intensity resistance training program [ 200 ]. The supplements did not improve participants' muscular strength or lean body mass compared with placebo, but they significantly decreased HDL cholesterol levels and raised levels of serum estrogens. Among participants taking the androstenedione, testosterone levels increased significantly by 16% after 1 month of use but declined to pretreatment levels by 12 weeks, in part due to downregulation of endogenous testosterone synthesis.\nIn March 2004, FDA warned companies to cease distributing androstenedione-containing dietary supplements. The rationale was the lack of sufficient information to establish that such products could reasonably be expected to be safe and that FDA had never approved androstenedione as a new dietary ingredient permitted in supplements [ 197 ]. The U.S. Department of Justice classified androstenedione as a Schedule III controlled substance (defined as a drug with a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence) in 2004 [ 201 ]. The National Collegiate Athletic Association, International Olympic Committee, and World Anti-Doping Agency ban the use of androstenedione [ 128 , 197 ].\n",
    "Dimethylamylamine": "Dimethylamylamine (DMAA) is a stimulant formerly included in some preworkout and other dietary supplements claimed to enhance exercise performance and build muscle. Studies have not evaluated DMAA in humans as a potential ergogenic aid. In 2013, FDA declared products containing this ingredient to be illegal after it received 86 reports of deaths and illnesses associated with dietary supplements containing DMAA. These reports described heart problems as well as nervous system and psychiatric disorders [ 202 ]. Furthermore, FDA had never approved DMAA as a new dietary ingredient that would reasonably be expected to be safe [ 202 ]. Although products marketed as dietary supplements containing DMAA are illegal in the United States, discontinued, reformulated, or even new products containing DMAA might still be found in the U.S. marketplace. The Department of Defense's Human Performance Resource Center maintains a list of currently available products that contain DMAA or are labeled as containing DMAA, 1-3-dimethylamylamine, or an equivalent chemical or marketing name (e.g., methylhexaneamine or geranium extract) [ 203 ].\nFDA also determined that dietary supplements containing 1,3-dimethybutylamine (DMBA), a stimulant chemically related to DMAA, are adulterated. As with DMAA, FDA had never approved this stimulant as a new dietary ingredient. The agency contended that there is no history of use or data offering sufficient assurance that this compound is not associated with a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury [ 204 , 205 ].\n",
    "Ephedra": "Ephedra (also known as ma huang), a plant native to China, contains ephedrine alkaloids, which are stimulant compounds; the primary alkaloid is ephedrine [ 206 ]. In the 1990s, ephedra—frequently combined with caffeine—was a popular ingredient in dietary supplements sold to enhance exercise and athletic performance and to promote weight loss.\nNo studies have evaluated the use of ephedra dietary supplements, with or without caffeine, as ergogenic aids. Instead, available studies have used the related synthetic compound ephedrine together with caffeine and typically measured the effects 1–2 hours after a single dose [ 207 , 208 ]. These studies showed that the ephedrine–caffeine combination produced a 20%–30% increase in power and endurance, but ephedrine alone had no significant effects on exercise-performance parameters, such as oxygen consumption or time to exhaustion [ 208 ]. No data show any sustained improvement in athletic performance over time with continued dosing of ephedrine with caffeine [ 207 ].\nEphedra use has been associated with death and serious adverse effects, including nausea, vomiting, psychiatric symptoms (such as anxiety and mood change), hypertension, palpitations, stroke, seizures, and heart attack [ 206 , 207 ]. In 2004, FDA banned the sale of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids in the United States because they are associated with an unreasonable risk of illness or injury [ 207 ]. The World Anti-Doping Agency prohibits the use of ephedrine in amounts that lead to urine concentrations of ephedrine (or the related methylephedrine) exceeding 10 mcg/ml [ 107 ].\n",
    "Regulation of Dietary Supplements to Enhance Exercise and Athletic Performance": "FDA regulates dietary supplements for exercise and athletic performance in accordance with the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 [ 209 ]. Like other dietary supplements, exercise- and athletic-performance supplements differ from over-the-counter or prescription medications in that they do not require premarket review or approval by FDA. Supplement manufacturers are responsible for determining that their products are safe and their label claims are truthful and not misleading, although they are not required to provide this evidence to FDA before marketing their products. If FDA finds a supplement to be unsafe, it may remove the product from the market or ask the manufacturer to voluntarily recall the product. FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) may also take regulatory actions against manufacturers that make unsubstantiated physical-performance or other claims about their products.\nFDA permits dietary supplements to contain only dietary ingredients, such as vitamins, minerals, amino acids, herbs, and other botanicals. It does not permit these products to contain pharmaceutical ingredients, and manufacturers may not promote them to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease [ 209 ].\nFor more information about dietary supplement regulation, see the ODS publication, Dietary Supplements: What You Need to Know .\n",
    "Safety Considerations": "Like all dietary supplements, supplements used to enhance exercise and athletic performance can have side effects and might interact with prescription and over-the-counter medications. In some cases, the active constituents of botanical or other ingredients promoted as ergogenic aids are unknown or uncharacterized. Furthermore, many such products contain multiple ingredients that have not been adequately tested in combination with one another. People interested in taking dietary supplements to enhance their exercise and athletic performance should talk with their health care providers about the use of these products.\nThe Uniformed Services University and the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency maintain a list of products marketed as dietary supplements that contain stimulants, steroids, hormone-like ingredients, controlled substances, or unapproved drugs and that can have health risks for warfighters and others who take them for bodybuilding or other forms of physical performance [ 210 ].\n",
    "Fraudulent and adulterated products": "FDA requires the manufacture of dietary supplements to comply with quality standards that ensure that these products contain only the labeled ingredients and amounts and are free of undeclared substances and unsafe levels of contaminants [ 211 ]. However, FDA notes that products marketed as dietary supplements for bodybuilding are among those most often adulterated with undeclared or deceptively labeled ingredients, such as synthetic anabolic steroids or prescription medications [ 212 ]. As one example, some products sold for bodybuilding are adulterated with selective androgen receptor modulators; these synthetic drugs are designed to mimic the effects of testosterone [ 213 ]. Using such tainted products can cause health problems and lead to disqualification of athletes from competition if a drug test shows that they have consumed prohibited substances, even if they have done so unknowingly. FDA has warned against the use of any body-building products that claim to contain steroids or steroid-like substances [ 214 ]. It recommends that a user contact their health care provider if they experience symptoms possibly related to these products, especially nausea, weakness, fatigue, fever, abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, jaundice (yellowing of skin or whites of eyes), or brown or discolored urine.\nSome dietary-supplement firms have hired third-party certification companies to verify the identity and content of their supplements to enhance exercise and athletic performance, thus providing some extra, independent assurance that the products contain the labeled amounts of ingredients and are free of many banned substances and drugs. The major companies providing this certification service are NSF (nsf.org) through its Certified for Sport program, Informed-Choice (informed-choice.org), and the Banned Substances Control Group (bscg.org). The products that meet the requirements of these companies may carry the certifier’s official logo and are listed on the certifier’s website.\n",
    "Interactions with medications": "Some ingredients in dietary supplements used to enhance exercise and athletic performance can interact with certain medications. For example, intakes of large doses of antioxidant supplements, such as vitamins C and E, during cancer chemotherapy or radiotherapy could reduce the effectiveness of these therapies by inhibiting cellular oxidative damage in cancerous cells [ 215 ]. Ginseng can reduce the anticoagulant effects of the blood thinner warfarin (Coumadin or Jantoven) [ 216 ]. Iron supplements can reduce the bioavailability of levodopa (used to treat Parkinson's disease) and levothyroxine (Levothyroid, Levoxyl, Synthroid, and others, for hypothyroidism and goiter), so users should take iron supplements at a different time of the day than these two drugs [ 217 , 218 ]. Cimetidine (Tagamet HB, used to treat duodenal ulcers) can slow the rate of caffeine clearance from the body and thereby increase the risk of adverse effects from caffeine consumption [ 219 ].\nIndividuals taking dietary supplements and medications on a regular basis should discuss the use of these products with their health care providers.\n",
    "Choosing a Sensible Approach to Enhance Exercise and Athletic Performance": "According to the AND, DoC, and ACSM, sound science supports the use of only a few dietary supplements whose labels claim ergogenic benefits [ 12 ]. These organizations add that the best way to use supplements is as additions to a carefully chosen diet, that dietary supplements rarely have ergogenic benefits when not used in these conditions, and that there is no justification for their use by young athletes. The National Federation of State High School Associations also expresses strong opposition to the use of supplements to enhance athletic performance by high school students [ 15 ]. The American Academy of Pediatrics adds that performance-enhancing substances do not result in significant improvements in most teenage athletes beyond those that can result from proper nutrition and training basics [ 7 ].\nElite and recreational athletes perform at their best and recover most quickly when they consume a nutritionally adequate diet with sufficient fluids and when they have appropriate physical conditioning and proper training.\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans [ 10 ] and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's MyPlate [ 11 ]. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that:\nIncludes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium Limits alcoholic beverages Stays within your daily calorie needs\n",

    "Table of Contents": "Introduction Recommended Intakes Sources of Vitamin E Vitamin E Intakes and Status Vitamin E Deficiency Vitamin E and Health Health Risks from Excessive Vitamin E Interactions with Medications Vitamin E and Healthful Diets References Disclaimer\nThis is a fact sheet intended for health professionals.  For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet .\n",
    "Introduction": "Vitamin E is found naturally in some foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. Vitamin E is the collective name for a group of fat-soluble compounds with distinctive antioxidant activities [ 1 ].\nNaturally occurring vitamin E exists in eight chemical forms (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherol and alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocotrienol) that have varying levels of biological activity [ 1 ]. Alpha- (or α-) tocopherol is the only form that is recognized to meet human requirements.\nSerum concentrations of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) depend on the liver, which takes up the nutrient after the various forms are absorbed from the small intestine. The liver preferentially resecretes only alpha-tocopherol via the hepatic alpha-tocopherol transfer protein [ 1 ]; the liver metabolizes and excretes the other vitamin E forms [ 2 ]. As a result, blood and cellular concentrations of other forms of vitamin E are lower than those of alpha-tocopherol and have been the subjects of less research [ 3 , 4 ].\nAntioxidants protect cells from the damaging effects of free radicals, which are molecules that contain an unshared electron. Free radicals damage cells and might contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease and cancer [ 5 ]. Unshared electrons are highly energetic and react rapidly with oxygen to form reactive oxygen species (ROS). The body forms ROS endogenously when it converts food to energy, and antioxidants might protect cells from the damaging effects of ROS. The body is also exposed to free radicals from environmental exposures, such as cigarette smoke, air pollution, and ultraviolet radiation from the sun. ROS are part of signaling mechanisms among cells.\nVitamin E is a fat-soluble antioxidant that stops the production of ROS formed when fat undergoes oxidation. Scientists are investigating whether, by limiting free-radical production and possibly through other mechanisms, vitamin E might help prevent or delay the chronic diseases associated with free radicals.\nIn addition to its activities as an antioxidant, vitamin E is involved in immune function and, as shown primarily by in vitro studies of cells, cell signaling, regulation of gene expression, and other metabolic processes [ 1 ]. Alpha-tocopherol inhibits the activity of protein kinase C, an enzyme involved in cell proliferation and differentiation in smooth muscle cells, platelets, and monocytes [ 6 ]. Vitamin-E-replete endothelial cells lining the interior surface of blood vessels are better able to resist blood cell components adhering to this surface. Vitamin E also increases the expression of two enzymes that suppress arachidonic acid metabolism, thereby increasing the release of prostacyclin from the endothelium, which, in turn, dilates blood vessels and inhibits platelet aggregation [ 6 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for vitamin E and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the Institute of Medicine of The National Academies (formerly National Academy of Sciences) [ 6 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used to plan and assess nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and gender, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nThe FNB's vitamin E recommendations are for alpha-tocopherol alone, the only form maintained in plasma. The FNB based these recommendations primarily on serum levels of the nutrient that provide adequate protection in a test measuring the survival of erythrocytes when exposed to hydrogen peroxide, a free radical [ 6 ]. Acknowledging great uncertainties in these data, the FNB has called for research to identify other biomarkers for assessing vitamin E requirements.\nNaturally sourced vitamin E is called RRR -alpha-tocopherol (commonly labeled as d -alpha-tocopherol); the synthetically produced form is all rac -alpha-tocopherol (commonly labeled as dl -alpha-tocopherol).\nRDAs for vitamin E are provided in milligrams (mg) and are listed in Table 1. One mg vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) is equivalent to 1 mg RRR -alpha-tocopherol or 2 mg all rac -alpha-tocopherol. Because insufficient data are available to develop RDAs for infants, AIs were developed based on the amount of vitamin E consumed by healthy breastfed babies.\n*Adequate Intake (AI)\n",
    "Food": "Numerous foods provide vitamin E. Nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils are among the best sources of alpha-tocopherol, and significant amounts are available in green leafy vegetables and fortified cereals (see Table 2 for a more detailed list) [ 9 ]. Most vitamin E in American diets is in the form of gamma-tocopherol from soybean, canola, corn, and other vegetable oils and food products [ 4 ].\n*DV = Daily Value. FDA developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for vitamin E is 15 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 7 ]. One mg vitamin E = 1 mg RRR -alpha-tocopherol = 2 mg all rac -alpha-tocopherol. FDA does not require food labels to list vitamin E content unless vitamin E has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) FoodData Central website lists the nutrient content of many foods, including, in some cases, the amounts of alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherol. The USDA also provides a comprehensive list of foods containing vitamin E arranged by nutrient content and by food name .\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "Supplements of vitamin E typically provide only alpha-tocopherol, although mixed products containing other tocopherols and even tocotrienols are available. Naturally occurring alpha-tocopherol exists in one stereoisomeric form. In contrast, synthetically produced alpha-tocopherol contains equal amounts of its eight possible stereoisomers; serum and tissues maintain only four of these stereoisomers [ 6 ]. A given amount of synthetic alpha-tocopherol ( all rac -alpha-tocopherol; commonly labeled as DL or dl) is therefore only half as active as the same amount (by weight in mg) of the natural form ( RRR -alpha-tocopherol; commonly labeled as D or d).\nMost vitamin-E-only supplements provide ≥67 mg (100 IU of natural vitamin E) of the nutrient. These amounts are substantially higher than the RDAs.\nAlpha-tocopherol in dietary supplements and fortified foods is often esterified to prolong its shelf life while protecting its antioxidant properties. The body hydrolyzes and absorbs these esters (alpha-tocopheryl acetate and succinate) as efficiently as alpha-tocopherol [ 6 ].\n",

    "Cancer": "Antioxidant nutrients like vitamin E protect cell constituents from the damaging effects of free radicals that, if unchecked, might contribute to cancer development [ 9 ]. Vitamin E might also block the formation of carcinogenic nitrosamines formed in the stomach from nitrites in foods and protect against cancer by enhancing immune function [ 28 ]. Unfortunately, human trials and surveys that have attempted to associate vitamin E intake with cancer incidence have found that vitamin E is not beneficial in most cases.\nBoth the HOPE-TOO Trial and Women's Health Study evaluated whether vitamin E supplements might protect people from cancer. HOPE-TOO, which followed men and women ≥55 years of age with heart disease or diabetes for 7 years, found no significant differences in the number of new cancers or cancer deaths between individuals randomly assigned to take 400 IU/day of natural vitamin E (268 mg) or a placebo [ 22 ]. In the Women's Health Study, in which healthy women ≥45 years of age received either 600 IU of natural vitamin E (402 mg) every other day or a placebo for 10 years, the supplement did not reduce the risk of developing any form of cancer [ 25 ].\nSeveral studies have examined whether vitamin E intake and/or supplemental vitamin E affects the risk of developing prostate cancer. A prospective cohort study of >29,000 men found no association between dietary or supplemental vitamin E intake and prostate cancer risk [ 29 ]. However, among current smokers and men who had quit, vitamin E intakes of more than 400 IU/day (form not specified) were associated with a statistically significant 71% reduction in the risk of advanced prostate cancer. In a clinical trial involving 29,133 male smokers, men randomly assigned to take daily supplements of 111 IU of synthetic vitamin E (50 mg, as dl -alpha-tocopheryl acetate) for 5–8 years had 32% fewer prostate cancers compared to subjects who did not take the supplements [ 30 ]. Based in part on the promising results of this study, a large randomized clinical trial, called the SELECT trial, began in 2001 to determine whether 7–12 years of daily supplementation with 400 IU of synthetic vitamin E (180 mg, as dl -alpha-tocopheryl acetate), with or without selenium (200 mcg, as L-selenomethionine), reduced the number of new prostate cancers in 35,533 healthy men age 50 and older. The trial was discontinued in October 2008 when an analysis found that the supplements, taken alone or together for about 5.5 years, did not prevent prostate cancer [ 31 ]. Results from an additional 1.5 years of follow-up from this trial (during which the subjects no longer received vitamin E or selenium), showed that the men who had taken the vitamin E had a 17% increased risk of prostate cancer compared to men only taking placebos, a statistically significant difference [ 32 ]. The risk of developing prostate cancer was also slightly increased in subjects taking vitamin E plus selenium or selenium alone, but the differences were not statistically significant. No differences were found among groups in the incidence of lung or colorectal cancers or all cancers combined. Study staff members will continue to monitor participants' health for up to 5 more years. The National Cancer Institute website provides additional information on the SELECT trial .\nOne study of women in Iowa provides evidence that higher intakes of vitamin E from foods and supplements could decrease the risk of colon cancer, especially in women <65 years of age [ 33 ]. The overall relative risk for the highest quintile of intake (>35.7 IU/day, form not specified) compared to the lowest quintile (<5.7 IU/day, form not specified) was 0.32. However, prospective cohort studies of 87,998 women in the Nurses' Health Study and 47,344 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study failed to replicate these results [ 34 ]. Although some research links higher intakes of vitamin E with decreased incidence of breast cancer, an examination of the impact of dietary factors, including vitamin E, on the incidence of postmenopausal breast cancer in >18,000 women found no benefit from the vitamin [ 35 ].\nThe American Cancer Society conducted an epidemiologic study examining the association between use of vitamin C and vitamin E supplements and bladder cancer mortality. Of the almost one million adults followed between 1982 and 1998, adults who took supplemental vitamin E for 10 years or longer had a reduced risk of death from bladder cancer [ 36 ]; vitamin C supplementation provided no protection.\nEvidence to date is insufficient to support taking vitamin E to prevent cancer. In fact, daily use of large-dose vitamin E supplements (400 IU of synthetic vitamin E [180 mg]) may increase the risk of prostate cancer.\n",

    "International Units and Milligrams": "Vitamin E is listed on the new Nutrition Facts and Supplement Facts labels in mg [ 7 ]. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required manufacturers to use these new labels starting in January 2020, but companies with annual sales of less than $10 million were allowed to use the old labels that list vitamin E in International Units (IUs) until January 2021 [ 8 ]. Conversion rules are as follows:\nTo convert from mg to IU: 1 mg of alpha-tocopherol is equivalent to 1.49 IU of the natural form or 2.22 IU of the synthetic form. To convert from IU to mg: 1 IU of the natural form is equivalent to 0.67 mg of alpha-tocopherol. ​​​​​​​1 IU of the synthetic form is equivalent to 0.45 mg of alpha-tocopherol.\n1 mg of alpha-tocopherol is equivalent to 1.49 IU of the natural form or 2.22 IU of the synthetic form.\n1 IU of the natural form is equivalent to 0.67 mg of alpha-tocopherol. ​​​​​​​1 IU of the synthetic form is equivalent to 0.45 mg of alpha-tocopherol.\nFor example, 15 mg of natural alpha-tocopherol would equal 22.4 IU (15 mg x 1.49 IU/mg = 22.4 IU). The corresponding value for synthetic alpha-tocopherol would be 33.3 IU (15 mg x 2.22 IU/mg).\n",
    "Vitamin E Intakes and Status": "Three national surveys—the 2001–2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) [ 10 ], NHANES III (1988–1994) [ 10 ], and the Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (1994–1996) [ 11 ]—have found that the diets of most Americans provide less than the RDA levels of vitamin E. These intake estimates might be low, however, because the amounts and types of fat added during cooking are often unknown and not accounted for [ 6 ].\nThe FNB suggests that mean intakes of vitamin E among healthy adults are probably higher than the RDA but cautions that low-fat diets might provide insufficient amounts unless people make their food choices carefully by, for example, increasing their intakes of nuts, seeds, fruits, and vegetables [ 6 , 10 ]. The 1999–2000 NHANES found that 11.3% of adults took vitamin E supplements containing at least 400 IU [ 12 ].\n",
    "Vitamin E Deficiency": "Frank vitamin E deficiency is rare and overt deficiency symptoms have not been found in healthy people who obtain little vitamin E from their diets [ 6 ]. Premature babies of very low birth weight (<1,500 grams) might be deficient in vitamin E. Vitamin E supplementation in these infants might reduce the risk of some complications, such as those affecting the retina, but they can also increase the risk of infections [ 13 ].\nBecause the digestive tract requires fat to absorb vitamin E, people with fat-malabsorption disorders are more likely to become deficient than people without such disorders. Deficiency symptoms include peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, skeletal myopathy, retinopathy, and impairment of the immune response [ 6 , 14 ]. People with Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis, or an inability to secrete bile from the liver into the digestive tract, for example, often pass greasy stools or have chronic diarrhea; as a result, they sometimes require water-soluble forms of vitamin E, such as tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-1000 succinate [ 1 ].\nSome people with abetalipoproteinemia, a rare inherited disorder resulting in poor absorption of dietary fat, require enormous doses of supplemental vitamin E (approximately 100 mg/kg or 5–10 g/day) [ 1 ]. Vitamin E deficiency secondary to abetalipoproteinemia causes such problems as poor transmission of nerve impulses, muscle weakness, and retinal degeneration that leads to blindness [ 15 ]. Ataxia and vitamin E deficiency (AVED) is another rare, inherited disorder in which the liver's alpha-tocopherol transfer protein is defective or absent. People with AVED have such severe vitamin E deficiency that they develop nerve damage and lose the ability to walk unless they take large doses of supplemental vitamin E [ 16 ].\n",
    "Vitamin E and Health": "Many claims have been made about vitamin E's potential to promote health and prevent and treat disease. The mechanisms by which vitamin E might provide this protection include its function as an antioxidant and its roles in anti-inflammatory processes, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and immune enhancement.\nA primary barrier to characterizing the roles of vitamin E in health is the lack of validated biomarkers for vitamin E intake and status to help relate intakes to valid predictors of clinical outcomes [ 6 ]. This section focuses on four diseases and disorders in which vitamin E might be involved: heart disease, cancer, eye disorders, and cognitive decline.\n",
    "Coronary heart disease": "Evidence that vitamin E could help prevent or delay coronary heart disease (CHD) comes from several sources. In vitro studies have found that the nutrient inhibits oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, thought to be a crucial initiating step for atherosclerosis [ 6 ]. Vitamin E might also help prevent the formation of blood clots that could lead to a heart attack or venous thromboembolism [ 17 ].\nSeveral observational studies have associated lower rates of heart disease with higher vitamin E intakes. One study of approximately 90,000 nurses found that the incidence of heart disease was 30% to 40% lower in those with the highest intakes of vitamin E, primarily from supplements [ 18 ]. Among a group of 5,133 Finnish men and women followed for a mean of 14 years, higher vitamin E intakes from food were associated with decreased mortality from CHD [ 19 ].\nHowever, randomized clinical trials cast doubt on the efficacy of vitamin E supplements to prevent CHD [ 20 ]. For example, the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study, which followed almost 10,000 patients at high risk of heart attack or stroke for 4.5 years [ 21 ], found that participants taking 400 IU/day of natural vitamin E (268 mg) experienced no fewer cardiovascular events or hospitalizations for heart failure or chest pain than participants taking a placebo. In the HOPE-TOO follow-up study, almost 4,000 of the original participants continued to take vitamin E or placebo for an additional 2.5 years [ 22 ]. HOPE-TOO found that vitamin E provided no significant protection against heart attacks, strokes, unstable angina, or deaths from cardiovascular disease or other causes after 7 years of treatment. Participants taking vitamin E, however, were 13% more likely to experience, and 21% more likely to be hospitalized for, heart failure, a statistically significant but unexpected finding not reported in other large studies.\nThe HOPE and HOPE-TOO trials provide compelling evidence that moderately high doses of vitamin E supplements do not reduce the risk of serious cardiovascular events among men and women >50 years of age with established heart disease or diabetes [ 23 ]. These findings are supported by evidence from the Women's Angiographic Vitamin and Estrogen study, in which 423 postmenopausal women with some degree of coronary stenosis took supplements with 400 IU vitamin E (form not specified) and 500 mg vitamin C twice a day or placebo for >4 years [ 24 ]. Not only did the supplements provide no cardiovascular benefits, but all-cause mortality was significantly higher in the women taking the supplements.\nThe latest published clinical trial of vitamin E's effects on the heart and blood vessels of women included almost 40,000 healthy women ≥45 years of age who were randomly assigned to receive either 600 IU of natural vitamin E (402 mg) on alternate days or placebo and who were followed for an average of 10 years [ 25 ]. The investigators found no significant differences in rates of overall cardiovascular events (combined nonfatal heart attacks, strokes, and cardiovascular deaths) or all-cause mortality between the groups. However, the study did find two positive and significant results for women taking vitamin E: they had a 24% reduction in cardiovascular death rates, and those ≥65 years of age had a 26% decrease in nonfatal heart attack and a 49% decrease in cardiovascular death rates.\nThe most recent published clinical trial of vitamin E and men's cardiovascular health included almost 15,000 healthy physicians ≥50 years of age who were randomly assigned to receive 400 IU synthetic alpha-tocopherol (180 mg) every other day, 500 mg vitamin C daily, both vitamins, or placebo [ 26 ]. During a mean follow-up period of 8 years, intake of vitamin E (and/or vitamin C) had no effect on the incidence of major cardiovascular events, myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular morality. Furthermore, use of vitamin E was associated with a significantly increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke.\nIn general, clinical trials have not provided evidence that routine use of vitamin E supplements prevents cardiovascular disease or reduces its morbidity and mortality. However, participants in these studies have been largely middle-aged or elderly individuals with demonstrated heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. Some researchers have suggested that understanding the potential utility of vitamin E in preventing CHD might require longer studies in younger participants taking higher doses of the supplement [ 27 ]. Further research is needed to determine whether supplemental vitamin E has any protective value for younger, healthier people at no obvious risk of CHD.\n",
    "Eye disorders": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts are among the most common causes of significant vision loss in older people. Their etiologies are usually unknown, but the cumulative effects of oxidative stress have been postulated to play a role. If so, nutrients with antioxidant functions, such as vitamin E, could be used to prevent or treat these conditions.\nProspective cohort studies have found that people with relatively high dietary intakes of vitamin E (e.g., 20 mg/day [30 IU]) have an approximately 20% lower risk of developing AMD than people with low intakes (e.g., <10 mg/day [<15 IU]) [ 37 , 38 ]. However, two randomized controlled trials in which participants took supplements of vitamin E (500 IU/day [335 mg] d -alpha-tocopherol in one study [ 39 ] and 111 IU/day (50 mg) dl -alpha-tocopheryl acetate combined with 20 mg/day beta-carotene in the other [ 40 ]) or a placebo failed to show a protective effect for vitamin E on AMD. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), a large randomized clinical trial, found that participants at high risk of developing advanced AMD (i.e., those with intermediate AMD or those with advanced AMD in one eye) reduced their risk of developing advanced AMD by 25% by taking a daily supplement containing vitamin E (400 IU [180 mg] dl -alpha-tocopheryl acetate), beta-carotene (15 mg), vitamin C (500 mg), zinc (80 mg), and copper (2 mg) compared to participants taking a placebo over 5 years [ 41 ]. A follow-up AREDS2 study confirmed the value of this and similar supplement formulations in reducing the progression of AMD over a median follow-up period of 5 years [ 42 ].\nSeveral observational studies have revealed a potential relationship between vitamin E supplements and the risk of cataract formation. One prospective cohort study found that lens clarity was superior in participants who took vitamin E supplements and those with higher blood levels of the vitamin [ 43 ]. In another study, long-term use of vitamin E supplements was associated with slower progression of age-related lens opacification [ 44 ]. However, in the AREDS trial, the use of a vitamin E-containing (as dl -alpha-tocopheryl acetate) formulation had no apparent effect on the development or progression of cataracts over an average of 6.3 years [ 45 ]. The AREDS2 study, which also tested formulations containing 400 IU (180 mg) vitamin E, confirmed these findings [ 46 ].\nOverall, the available evidence is inconsistent with respect to whether vitamin E supplements, taken alone or in combination with other antioxidants, can reduce the risk of developing AMD or cataracts. However, the formulations of vitamin E, other antioxidants, zinc, and copper used in AREDS hold promise for slowing the progression of AMD in people at high risk of developing advanced AMD.\n",
    "Cognitive decline": "The brain has a high oxygen consumption rate and abundant polyunsaturated fatty acids in the neuronal cell membranes. Researchers hypothesize that if cumulative free-radical damage to neurons over time contributes to cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, then ingestion of sufficient or supplemental antioxidants (such as vitamin E) might provide some protection [ 47 ]. This hypothesis was supported by the results of a clinical trial in 341 patients with Alzheimer's disease of moderate severity who were randomly assigned to receive a placebo, vitamin E (2,000 IU/day dl -alpha-tocopherol), a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (selegiline), or vitamin E and selegiline [ 47 ]. Over 2 years, treatment with vitamin E and selegiline, separately or together, significantly delayed functional deterioration and the need for institutionalization compared to placebo. However, participants taking vitamin E experienced significantly more falls.\nVitamin E consumption from foods or supplements was associated with less cognitive decline over 3 years in a prospective cohort study of elderly, free-living individuals age 65–102 years [ 48 ]. However, a clinical trial in primarily healthy older women who were randomly assigned to receive 600 IU (402 mg) d -alpha-tocopherol every other day or a placebo for ≤4 years found that the supplements provided no apparent cognitive benefits [ 49 ]. Another trial in which 769 men and women with mild cognitive impairment were randomly assigned to receive 2,000 IU/day vitamin E (form not specified), a cholinesterase inhibitor (donepezil), or placebo found no significant differences in the progression rate of Alzheimer's disease between the vitamin E and placebo groups [ 50 ]\nIn summary, most research results do not support the use of vitamin E supplements by healthy or mildly impaired individuals to maintain cognitive performance or slow its decline with normal aging [ 51 ]. More research is needed to identify the role of vitamin E, if any, in the management of cognitive impairment [ 52 ].\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Vitamin E": "Research has not found any adverse effects from consuming vitamin E in food [ 6 ]. However, high doses of alpha-tocopherol supplements can cause hemorrhage and interrupt blood coagulation in animals, and in vitro data suggest that high doses inhibit platelet aggregation. Two clinical trials have found an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke in participants taking alpha-tocopherol; one trial included Finnish male smokers who consumed 50 mg/day for an average of 6 years [ 53 ] and the other trial involved a large group of male physicians in the United States who consumed 400 IU (180 mg) of synthetic vitamin E every other day for 8 years [ 26 ]. Because the majority of physicians in the latter study were also taking aspirin, this finding could indicate that vitamin E has a tendency to cause bleeding.\nThe FNB has established ULs for vitamin E based on the potential for hemorrhagic effects (see Table 3). The ULs apply to all forms of supplemental alpha-tocopherol, including the eight stereoisomers present in synthetic vitamin E. Doses of up to 1,000 mg/day (1,500 IU/day of the natural form or 1,100 IU/day of the synthetic form) in adults appear to be safe, although the data are limited and based on small groups of people taking up to 3,200 mg/day of alpha-tocopherol for only a few weeks or months. Long-term intakes above the UL increase the risk of adverse health effects [ 6 ]. Vitamin E ULs for infants have not been established.\nTwo meta-analyses of randomized trials have also raised questions about the safety of large doses of vitamin E, including doses lower than the UL. These meta-analyses linked supplementation to small but statistically significant increases in all-cause mortality. One analysis found an increased risk of death at doses of 400 IU/day (form not specified), although the risk began to increase at 150 IU [ 54 ]. In the other analysis of studies of antioxidant supplements for disease prevention, the highest quality trials revealed that vitamin E, administered singly (dose range 10 IU–5,000 IU/day; mean 569 IU [form not specified]) or combined with up to four other antioxidants, significantly increased mortality risk [ 55 ].\nThe implications of these analyses for the potential adverse effects of high-dose vitamin E supplements are unclear [ 56-59 ]. Participants in the studies included in these analyses were typically middle-aged or older and had chronic diseases or related risk factors. These participants often consumed other supplements in addition to vitamin E. Some of the studies analyzed took place in developing countries in which nutritional deficiencies are common. A review of the subset of studies in which vitamin E supplements were given to healthy individuals for the primary prevention of chronic disease found no convincing evidence that the supplements increased mortality [ 60 ].\nHowever, results from the recently published, large SELECT trial show that vitamin E supplements (400 IU/day [180 mg] as dl -alpha-tocopheryl acetate) may harm adult men in the general population by increasing their risk of prostate cancer [ 32 ]. Follow-up studies are assessing whether the cancer risk was associated with baseline blood levels of vitamin E and selenium prior to supplementation as well as whether changes in one or more genes might increase a man's risk of developing prostate cancer while taking vitamin E.\n",
    "Anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications": "Vitamin E can inhibit platelet aggregation and antagonize vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. As a result, taking large doses with anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, such as warfarin (Coumadin), can increase the risk of bleeding, especially in conjunction with low vitamin K intake. The amounts of supplemental vitamin E needed to produce clinically significant effects are unknown but probably exceed 400 IU/day [ 61 ].\n",
    "Simvastatin and niacin": "Some people take vitamin E supplements with other antioxidants, such as vitamin C, selenium, and beta-carotene. This collection of antioxidant ingredients blunted the rise in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, especially levels of HDL2, the most cardioprotective HDL component, among people treated with a combination of simvastatin (brand name Zocor) and niacin [ 62 , 63 ].\n",
    "Chemotherapy and radiotherapy": "Oncologists generally advise against the use of antioxidant supplements during cancer chemotherapy or radiotherapy because they might reduce the effectiveness of these therapies by inhibiting cellular oxidative damage in cancerous cells [ 64 , 65 ]. Although a systematic review of randomized controlled trials has called this concern into question [ 66 ], further research is needed to evaluate the potential risks and benefits of concurrent antioxidant supplementation with conventional therapies for cancer.\n",
    "Vitamin E and Healthful Diets": "The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. ​​​​​​​Vitamin E is found in green leafy vegetables, whole grains, fortified cereals, and vegetable oils. Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. ​​​​​​​Nuts are good sources of vitamin E. Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Limits alcoholic beverages.

    "Table of Contents": "Introduction Recommended Intakes Sources of Fluoride Fluoride Intakes and Status Fluoride and Health Health Risks from Excessive Fluoride Interactions with Fluoride Fluoride and Healthful Diets References Disclaimer\nThis is a fact sheet intended for health professionals.  For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet .\n",
    "Introduction": "Fluoride, a mineral, is naturally present in many foods and available as a dietary supplement. Fluoride is the ionic form of the element fluorine, and it inhibits or reverses the initiation and progression of dental caries (tooth decay) and stimulates new bone formation [ 1 ].\nSoil, water, plants, and foods contain trace amounts of fluoride. Most of the fluoride that people consume comes from fluoridated water, foods and beverages prepared with fluoridated water, and toothpaste and other dental products containing fluoride [ 2 , 3 ].\nApproximately 80% or more of orally ingested fluoride is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract [ 1 ]. In adults, about 50% of absorbed fluoride is retained in the body, with all but 1% stored in bones and teeth [ 1 , 3 ]. The other 50% is excreted in urine [ 1 ]. In young children, up to 80% of absorbed fluoride is retained because more is taken up by bones and teeth than in adults [ 1 ].\nIndividual fluoride status is not typically assessed, although fluoride concentrations can be measured in plasma, saliva, urine, bones, nails, hair, and teeth [ 4 , 5 ]. Criteria for adequate, high, or low levels of fluoride in the body have not been established.\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for fluoride and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [ 1 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nThe FNB found the data insufficient to derive EARs for fluoride. Therefore, the board established AIs for all ages using estimated intakes shown to maximize reductions in the incidence of dental caries without unwanted side effects, such as dental fluorosis, a chronic condition resulting from the consumption of too much fluoride when teeth are developing [ 1 ]. Table 1 lists the current AIs for fluoride for healthy individuals.\n",
    "Food": "Brewed tea typically contains higher levels of fluoride than most foods, depending on the type of tea and its source, because tea plants take up fluoride from soil [ 1 , 3 ]. Fluoride levels can range from 0.3 to 6.5 mg/L (0.07 to 1.5 mg/cup) in brewed tea made with distilled water [ 3 ].\nFluoride concentrations in breast milk are so low that they cannot always be detected; when these levels can be measured, they range from less than 0.002 to 0.01 mg/L, even when mothers live in communities with fluoridated water [ 3 ]. Fluoride concentrations in cow’s milk are also very low, ranging from 0.007 to 0.086 mg/L [ 3 ]. Fluoride levels in infant formulas in the United States vary, depending on the type of formula and the fluoride content of the water used to prepare the formula [ 3 ]. The typical fluoride concentration is less than 0.2 mg/L in milk-based infant formula and 0.2 to 0.3 mg/L in soy-based infant formula (not including contributions from tap water used to prepare the formula).\nOnly trace amounts of fluoride are naturally present in most foods, and most foods not prepared with fluoridated water provide less than 0.05 mg/100 g [ 1 , 6 ].\nA variety of types of foods and their fluoride levels per serving are listed in Table 2.\n*Amounts of fluoride might vary by levels in the water used to prepare these foods and beverages.\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "Only a few dietary supplements contain fluoride, usually in the form of sodium fluoride [ 17 ]. Most of these products are multivitamin/mineral supplements, multivitamins plus fluoride, or supplements containing trace minerals only. Some fluoride supplements, usually intended for children, are in the form of drops. The most common amount of fluoride in supplements is 0.25 mg, although a few products contain 0.5 or 1 mg per serving [ 17 ].\n",

    "Fluoridated drinking water": "Since 1962, the U.S. Public Health Service has recommended the addition of fluoride to drinking (tap) water to reduce the risk and severity of dental caries, one of the most common chronic diseases in children [ 8 ]. Many countries around the world now adjust the fluoride concentration of community drinking water supplies to the level recommended for the prevention of dental caries [ 9 ].\nAlthough the U.S. Public Health Service recommended fluoride concentrations of 0.7 in warmer climates (where children were expected to drink more water) to 1.2 mg/L in cooler climates to prevent dental caries in 1962, it amended its recommended level in 2015 to 0.7 mg/L to maintain the ability to prevent caries while minimizing the risk of dental fluorosis [ 8 , 10 ]. In 1986, guidelines from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established a maximum allowable concentration of 4.0 mg/L fluoride in public drinking water systems to prevent adverse effects from fluoride exposure (such as bone disease) and a recommended maximum concentration of 2.0 mg/L to prevent dental fluorosis [ 3 , 11 ]. The EPA is currently reviewing this regulation [ 12 ].\nFluoridated municipal drinking water—including water that people drink as well as foods and beverages prepared using municipal drinking water—accounts for about 60% of fluoride intakes in the United States [ 3 , 8 ]. In 2020, 62.9% of the U.S. population had access to a fluoridated community water system [ 13 ]. The fluoride additives used to fluoridate drinking water in the United States are fluorosilicic acid, sodium fluorosilicate, and sodium fluoride [ 14 ]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a webpage that lists fluoride levels in tap water by county [ 15 ]. Because of differences in amounts of fluoride in groundwater, private water sources (including well water) have variable fluoride concentrations [ 11 ].\nFluoride is not typically added to bottled drinking waters. However, when fluoride is added, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stipulates that the total amount of fluoride (added plus naturally occurring) cannot exceed 0.7 mg/L [ 7 ]. Previously allowable levels ranged from 0.8 to 1.7 mg/L. FDA notes that this rule does not apply to bottled water without added fluoride that contains fluoride naturally from its source water. The amount of fluoride contained in bottled water is not required to be listed on the product label unless the label makes a claim about the product’s fluoride content [ 16 ].\n",
    "Dental products": "Most toothpaste sold in the United States contains fluoride in the form of sodium fluoride or monofluorophosphate, most commonly at a level of 1,000 to 1,100 mg/L (about 1.3 mg in a quarter teaspoon, a typical amount of toothpaste used for one brushing) [ 3 ]. The amount of fluoride ingested from toothpaste depends on the amount used, the person’s swallowing control, and how often the person uses toothpaste. Estimated typical amounts of fluoride ingested daily from toothpaste are 0.1 mg to 0.25 mg for infants and children age 0 to 5 years, 0.2 to 0.3 mg for children age 6 to 12 years, and 0.1 mg for adults [ 3 ]. Fluoride in toothpaste, regardless of its form, is well absorbed [ 1 ].\nOther dental products that provide fluoride include mouth rinses for home use, topical fluoride preparations applied in dentists’ offices or through school-based programs, and dental devices (e.g., orthodontic bracket adhesives, glass-ionomer and some composite resin dental restorative materials, and some dental sealants and cavity liners) [ 3 , 18 ]. Gels used by dentists are typically applied one to four times a year and can lead to ingestions of 1.3 to 31.2 mg fluoride each time; varnishes are least likely to produce a high bolus of fluoride [ 3 ].\n",
    "Medications": "Some prescription medications contain fluoride, but not as the active ingredient. For example, voriconazole (VFEND or Vfend) is an oral antifungal medication used to treat several infectious conditions, including invasive aspergillosis, candidemia, and candidiasis [ 19 ]. Fluoride is a constituent of voriconazole and long-term use (e.g., for 4 months or more) of this medication can lead to high fluoride concentrations in serum and plasma [ 20-24 ]. The prescribing information for voriconazole advises discontinuation of voriconazole if skeletal fluorosis or periostitis (inflammation of the membrane surrounding and protecting the bones) develops [ 19 ].\n",
    "Fluoride Intakes and Status": "Most people in the United States consume adequate amounts of fluoride through foods containing naturally occurring fluoride, fluoridated tap water, and food products made with fluoridated tap water. According to the EPA, typical daily fluoride intakes in the United States from foods and beverages (including fluoridated drinking water) are 1.2 to 1.6 mg for infants and toddlers younger than 4 years, 2.0 to 2.2 mg for children age 4–11 years, 2.4 mg for those age 11–14 years, and 2.9 mg for adults [ 10 ].\n",
    "Fluoride and Health": "This section focuses on two conditions in which fluoride might play a role: dental caries and bone fractures.\n",
    "Dental caries": "Dental caries occurs when cariogenic bacteria in the mouth ferment foods and produce acids that dissolve tooth mineral [ 25 ]. Over time, this tooth decay can cause pain and tooth loss. Without treatment, dental caries can cause infections, impair growth and weight gain during childhood, affect school performance, impair quality of life, and possibly result in death [ 26-29 ]. Adequate fluoride intakes reduce the risk of dental caries in its initial stages by inhibiting demineralization and the activity of bacteria in dental plaque and by enhancing tooth remineralization [ 27 ].\nWater fluoridation protects teeth in two main ways—by preventing the development of caries through ingestion of drinking water during the tooth-forming years and through direct contact of fluoride with teeth throughout life [ 30 , 31 ].\nA 2015 Cochrane Review included 20 prospective observational studies (most conducted before 1975) [ 9 ]. The results showed that children receiving fluoridated water had 35% fewer decayed, missing, and filled primary (baby) teeth, and 26% fewer decayed, missing, and filled permanent (adult) teeth than children receiving unfluoridated water. Fluoridation also increased the number of children with no decay in their baby teeth by 15% and the number of children with no decay in their permanent teeth by 14%. The authors concluded that water fluoridation is effective for reducing dental caries rates in both primary and permanent teeth in children. However, the reviewers were unable to assess the effectiveness of water fluoridation for preventing caries in adults because no evidence met the review’s inclusion criteria (which required studies to include at least two groups, one receiving fluoridated water and one receiving unfluoridated water).\nThe Cochrane Review’s findings were confirmed by a 2018 cross-sectional study on the associations between fluoridated community water and dental caries in the United States [ 32 ]. The authors analyzed data on 7,000 children age 2 to 8 years and 12,604 children and adolescents age 6 to 17 years who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Study (NHANES) from 1999 to 2004 and 2011 to 2014, respectively. The results showed that living in a county in which 75% or more of the drinking water contained at least 0.7 mg/L fluoride was associated with a 30% reduction in the rate of caries in primary teeth and a 12% reduction in the rate of caries in permanent teeth.\nSome evidence shows that the addition of fluoride to drinking water can also prevent dental caries in adults. An observational study included 3,779 individuals in Australia age 15 and older who participated in the Australian 2004–2006 National Survey of Adult Oral Health [ 33 ]. In adults exposed to fluoridated community water supplies for at least 14 years, rates of decayed, missing, or filled teeth were 11%–12% lower than in adults whose drinking water during this period had negligible amounts of fluoride. An earlier study in 876 Australian Defence Force members age 17–56 years found that the average rate of decayed, missing, and filled teeth was 24% lower in those with access to water containing 0.5 to 1 mg/L fluoride for at least half of their lifetime than in those exposed for less than 10% of their lifetime [ 34 ].\nThese findings show that fluoridated drinking water can prevent dental caries in children and adults.\nSome studies have assessed the impact of fluoride supplements on caries development in children. For example, a 2011 Cochrane Review of 11 randomized or quasi-randomized studies in a total of 7,196 children (most living in communities lacking access to fluoridated drinking water) found that 0.25–1 mg/day supplemental fluoride for 24–55 months reduced rates of decayed, missing, and filled tooth surfaces by 24% [ 35 ]. The authors concluded that fluoride supplements were associated with a lower caries incidence rate in permanent teeth. A 2013 systematic review found an even greater preventive effect of fluoride supplements on the basis of one randomized and four nonrandomized clinical trials in children [ 28 ]. The results showed that 0.25–1 mg/day fluoride supplementation reduced caries incidence rates in primary teeth by 48%–72% in areas where water fluoridation levels were lower than 0.6 mg/L. In two of these trials that monitored the children for 6–10 years, supplements were associated with a 33%–80% reduction in the incidence of caries at age 7–10 years.\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the American Dental Association have issued fluoride supplement recommendations for children whose water supply contains little or no fluoride [ 26 ]. These recommendations are summarized in Table 3.\n*No studies have addressed the dosage or duration of oral fluoride supplementation in this population. **Recommended doses are based on poor-quality evidence.\nOverall, the available evidence suggests that dietary supplements containing fluoride can reduce rates of dental caries in children who lack access to fluoridated drinking water. No studies have assessed the impact of fluoride supplements on caries development in adults.\nLike other nutrients, fluoride is transferred from a pregnant woman to her fetus, so a few studies have evaluated the use of fluoride supplements by pregnant women to prevent dental caries in their children. However, the authors of a 2017 Cochrane Review found only one randomized controlled trial published in 1997 that met the review’s inclusion criteria [ 37 ]. This study assessed caries rates in 798 3-year-old children whose mothers had received 1 mg/day fluoride during the last 6 months of pregnancy [ 38 ]. The results showed no significant difference in the proportions of children who had decayed or filled primary tooth surfaces or who had caries. The authors of the Cochrane Review concluded that the 1997 study was of very low quality and that no evidence shows that fluoride supplementation in pregnant women prevents dental caries in their offspring.\n",
    "Bone fractures": "Because fluoride helps stimulate the formation of new bone, researchers have hypothesized that fluoride supplements might reduce bone fracture risk. However, research to date has provided only limited evidence supporting this hypothesis [ 39-41 ].\nThe findings of observational studies on the impact of fluoride levels in water on bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture risk have been mixed. A study of 7,129 white women found no significant differences in bone mineral density or risk of hip, vertebral, wrist, or humerus fracture between those exposed and those not exposed to fluoridated water between 1950 and 1994 [ 40 ]. In contrast, in a study in 8,266 Chinese residents age 50 years or older, people with access to water fluoride levels of approximately 1 mg/L had a lower overall risk of fractures, but not of hip fractures, than those with access to water containing negligible fluoride levels [ 41 ].\nClinical trials have also had conflicting findings about the efficacy of fluoride dietary supplements to prevent bone fractures. For example, a meta-analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials in a total of 954 participants (four of the studies included people with osteoporosis) showed a significant reduction in vertebral and nonvertebral fracture risk with daily doses of up to 20 mg fluoride (in the form of monofluorophosphate or sodium fluoride), but not with higher doses [ 42 ]. A more recent randomized controlled trial found that 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/day fluoride for 1 year in 180 postmenopausal women did not change BMD at any site assessed [ 43 ].\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Fluoride": "Long-term ingestion of excess fluoride in infancy and childhood, when the teeth are being formed, can lead to dental fluorosis [ 44 ]. The characteristics of this chronic condition usually vary from almost imperceptible white lines or flecks to white or brown stains on teeth [ 2 ]. Severe dental fluorosis can lead to pitting in tooth enamel. The risk of dental fluorosis increases with fluoride intakes above recommended amounts [ 45 ]. Severe enamel fluorosis is rare and there is no indication that it is caused by the recommended level of fluoride in public tap water [ 3 , 31 ].\nAnalysis of 1999–2004 NHANES clinical exam data showed that 20.8% of people age 6 to 49 had mild or very mild dental fluorosis, 2.0% had moderate fluorosis, and less than 1% had severe fluorosis [ 44 ]. The prevalence of any dental fluorosis was highest, 40.6%, in adolescents age 12 to 15 and lowest, 8.7%, in those age 40 to 49.\nSubsequent analyses of NHANES data from 2001–2002 and 2011–2012 found that rates of dental fluorosis (from very mild to severe) increased during this 10-year period [ 46 , 47 ]. However, a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the reported increase in dental fluorosis prevalence between NHANES 2001–2004 and 2011–2014 is not biologically plausible [ 48 ]. The authors suggested that there may have been a change over time in how the examiners evaluated the level of fluorosis [ 48 , 49 ].\nAnalyses of more recent NHANES 2015-2016 data showed that about two-thirds of children and adolescents age 6 years and older had some dental fluorosis, most of which was very mild or mild [ 48 , 50 , 51 ]. Research indicates that very mild or mild fluorosis does not negatively affect oral health-related quality of life [ 52 , 53 ]. Moreover, fluorosis severity tends to decline during adolescence and young adulthood [ 54 , 55 ]. Based on NHANES 2015-2016 data, only 1.4 to 1.8% of children and adolescents age 6 years and older have moderate or severe fluorosis [ 48 , 50 , 51 ], and no evidence indicates that the recommended level of fluoride in public tap water leads to severe fluorosis [ 3 , 31 ].\nHigh doses of fluoride (typically from rare accidents resulting in excessively high levels of fluoridation of water, unintentional ingestion of fluoride products intended for topical use in dentists’ offices, or fluoride supplements inappropriately given to children) can result in nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, periostitis, and even death in rare cases [ 3 , 19 , 56 ]. According to one estimate, the acute dose that could cause serious systemic toxicity for fluoride is 5 mg/kg (e.g., 375 mg for someone who weighs 75 kg [165 pounds]) [ 56 ]. This dose would be virtually impossible to achieve from water or toothpaste containing standard levels of added fluoride.\nChronic, excess intakes of fluoride are also associated with skeletal fluorosis [ 57 ]. Its effects can range from occasional joint pain or stiffness to osteoporosis, muscle wasting, and neurological defects [ 1 , 58 ]. However, skeletal fluorosis is extremely rare in the United States and no evidence indicates that it is caused by the recommended level of fluoride in public tap water [ 1 , 57 ].\nOne study found an association between higher maternal urinary fluoride concentration (based on one spot urine sample) during the third trimester of pregnancy and higher rates of neurobehavioral problems in the child at 3 years of age [ 59 ]. However, another study found no association between exposure to fluoridated water during early childhood and subsequent emotional or behavioral development and executive functioning [ 60 ]. Other evidence suggests that higher fluoride intakes during early development, including during gestation, might be associated with a lower IQ and other cognitive impairments (e.g., delays in cognitive development) in children [ 61-63 ]. However, many experts consider this evidence to be weak and methodologically flawed [ 64-73 ].\nAnalyses of the association between fluoride and IQ in children suggest that dose is an important consideration. A 2023 meta-analysis of 8 studies found that fluoride exposure at concentrations similar to that used in fluoridated community drinking water in the United States is not associated with lower IQ scores [ 74 ]. Conversely, a 2024 review from the National Toxicology Program (NTP) concluded with moderate confidence that exposure to higher fluoride concentrations in drinking water (e.g., those above 1.5 mg/L) is associated with lower IQ in children [ 75 ]. The NTP review did not address lower concentrations of fluoride, such as the 0.7 mg/L concentration recommended by the U.S. Public Health Service for community drinking water.\nThe FNB has established ULs for fluoride from all sources for healthy individuals (Table 4) based on levels associated with dental and skeletal fluorosis [ 1 ].\n",

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet .\n",
    "Introduction": "Folate is a water-soluble B vitamin that is naturally present in some foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. Folate, formerly known as folacin and sometimes vitamin B9, is the generic term for naturally occurring food folates and folates in dietary supplements and fortified foods, including folic acid. Food folates are in the tetrahydrofolate (THF) form and usually have additional glutamate residues, making them polyglutamates [ 1 ]. Folic acid is the fully oxidized monoglutamate form of the vitamin that is used in fortified foods and most dietary supplements. Some dietary supplements also contain folate in the monoglutamyl form, 5-MTHF (also known as L-5-MTHF, 5-methyl-folate, L-methylfolate, and methylfolate).\nFolate functions as a coenzyme or cosubstrate in single-carbon transfers in the synthesis of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and metabolism of amino acids [ 1-3 ]. One of the most important folate-dependent reactions is the conversion of homocysteine to methionine in the synthesis of S-adenosyl-methionine, an important methyl donor. Another folate-dependent reaction, the methylation of deoxyuridylate to thymidylate in the formation of DNA, is required for proper cell division. An impairment of this reaction initiates a process that can lead to megaloblastic anemia, one of the hallmarks of folate deficiency [ 4 ].\nWhen consumed, food folates are hydrolyzed to the monoglutamate form in the gut prior to absorption by active transport across the intestinal mucosa [ 2 ]. Passive diffusion also occurs when pharmacological doses of folic acid are consumed. Before entering the bloodstream, the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase reduces the monoglutamate form to THF and converts it to either methyl or formyl forms [ 1 ]. The main form of folate in plasma is 5-MTHF.\nThe activity of dihydrofolate reductase varies greatly among individuals [ 3 ]. When the capacity of dihydrofolate reductase is exceeded, unmetabolized folic acid can be present in the blood [ 1 , 5 , 6 ]. Whether unmetabolized folic acid has any biological activity or can be used as a biomarker of folate status is not known [ 7 ]. Folate is also synthesized by colonic microbiota and can be absorbed across the colon, although the extent to which colonic folate contributes to folate status is unclear [ 8 ]. The total body content of folate is estimated to be 15 to 30 mg; about half of this amount is stored in the liver and the remainder in blood and body tissues [ 1 ].\nSerum folate concentrations are commonly used to assess folate status; a value above 3 ng/mL indicates adequacy [ 1 , 2 , 9 ]. This indicator, however, is sensitive to recent dietary intake, so it might not reflect long-term status. Erythrocyte folate concentrations provide a longer term measure of folate intakes; a concentration above 140 ng/mL indicates adequate folate status [ 2 , 3 , 7 , 9 ].\nA combination of serum or erythrocyte folate concentration and indicators of metabolic function can also be used to assess folate status. Plasma homocysteine concentration is a commonly used functional indicator of folate status because homocysteine levels rise when the body cannot convert homocysteine to methionine due to a 5-MTHF deficiency [ 9 ]. Homocysteine levels, however, are not a highly specific indicator of folate status because they can be influenced by other factors, including kidney dysfunction and deficiencies of vitamin B12 and other micronutrients [ 1 , 3 , 9 , 10 ]. The most commonly used cutoff value for elevated homocysteine levels is 16 micromol/L, although slightly lower values of 12 to 14 micromol/L have also been used [ 2 ]. A homocysteine cutoff of 10 micromol/L has been proposed for assessing folate status in populations [ 3 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for folate and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by an expert committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [ 2 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nTable 1 lists the current RDAs for folate as mcg of dietary folate equivalents (DFEs). The FNB developed DFEs to reflect the higher bioavailability of folic acid than that of food folate. At least 85% of folic acid is estimated to be bioavailable when taken with food, whereas only about 50% of folate naturally present in food is bioavailable [ 1 , 2 , 4 ]. Based on these values, the FNB defined DFE as follows:\n1 mcg DFE = 1 mcg food folate 1 mcg DFE = 0.6 mcg folic acid from fortified foods or dietary supplements consumed with foods 1 mcg DFE = 0.5 mcg folic acid from dietary supplements taken on an empty stomach\nFactors for converting mcg DFE to mcg for supplemental folate in the form of 5-MTHF have not been formally established [ 11 ].\nFor infants from birth to 12 months, the FNB established an AI for folate that is equivalent to the mean intake of folate in healthy, breastfed infants in the United States (see Table 1).\n*Adequate Intake (AI)\n",
    "Food": "Folate is naturally present in a wide variety of foods, including vegetables (especially dark green leafy vegetables), fruits and fruit juices, nuts, beans, peas, seafood, eggs, dairy products, meat, poultry, and grains (Table 2) [ 4 , 12 ]. Spinach, liver, asparagus, and brussels sprouts are among the foods with the highest folate levels.\nIn January 1998, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began requiring manufacturers to add 140 mcg folic acid/100 g to enriched breads, cereals, flours, corn meals, pastas, rice, and other grain products [ 13 ] to reduce the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs). Because cereals and grains are widely consumed in the United States, these products have become important contributors of folic acid to the American diet. The fortification program increased mean folic acid intakes in the United States by about 190 mcg/day [ 14 ]. In April 2016, FDA approved the voluntary addition of up to 154 mcg folic acid/100 g to corn masa flour [ 15 ].\nSince November 1, 1998, the Canadian government has also required the addition of 150 mcg folic acid/100 g to many grains, including enriched pasta, corn meal, and white flour [ 6 , 16 ]. Many other countries, including Costa Rica, Chile, and South Africa, have also established mandatory folic acid fortification programs [ 6 , 17 ].\n* DV = Daily Value. FDA developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for folate is 400 mcg DFE for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 11 ], where mcg DFE = mcg naturally occurring folate + (1.7 x mcg folic acid). The labels must list folate content in mcg DFE per serving and if folic acid is added to the product, they must also list the amount of folic acid in mcg in parentheses. FDA does not require food labels to list folate content unless folic acid has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. † Fortified with folic acid as part of the folate fortification program.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA's) FoodData Central [ 12 ] lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing folate arranged by nutrient content and by food name.\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "Folic acid is available in multivitamins and prenatal vitamins, supplements containing other B-complex vitamins, and supplements containing only folic acid. Common doses range from 680 to 1,360 mcg DFE (400 to 800 mcg folic acid) in supplements for adults and 340 to 680 mcg DFE (200 to 400 mcg folic acid) in children’s multivitamins [ 18 , 19 ].\nAbout 85% of supplemental folic acid, when taken with food, is bioavailable [ 2 , 4 ]. When consumed without food, nearly 100% of supplemental folic acid is bioavailable.\nDietary supplements containing 5-MTHF are also available. For some people, supplementation with 5-MTHF might be more beneficial than with folic acid (see People with an MTHFR polymorphism below) [ 20 , 21 ]. The bioavailability of 5-MTHF in supplements is the same as or greater than that of folic acid [ 22-27 ]. However, conversion factors between mcg and mcg DFE for 5-MTHF have not been formally established. FDA allows manufacturers to use either a conversion factor of 1.7 to be comparable to folic acid or their own established conversion factors not to exceed 1.7 [ 11 ].\n",

    "Cancer": "Several epidemiological studies have suggested an inverse association between folate intakes and status and the risk of colorectal, lung, pancreatic, esophageal, stomach, cervical, ovarian, breast, bladder, and other cancers [ 1 , 9 , 54 , 55 ]. Research has not established the precise nature of folate’s effect on carcinogenesis, but scientists hypothesize that folate might influence cancer development through its role in one-carbon metabolism and subsequent effects on DNA replication and cell division [ 55 , 56 ]. Evidence also indicates that folate might play a dual role in cancer initiation and progression [ 57 ]. That is, folate might suppress some types of cancer during the early stages of development, whereas high doses of folic acid taken after preneoplastic lesions have been established might promote cancer development and progression.\nResults from clinical trials involving folic acid supplementation have been mixed. In addition, most trials have included other B-vitamins (frequently at doses well above RDA levels) and sometimes other nutrients, making it difficult to disentangle the effects, if any, of folic acid alone. For example, in a trial in France, 2,501 people with a history of cardiovascular disease received daily supplements of 560 mcg folic acid, 3 mg vitamin B6, and 20 mcg vitamin B12 for 5 years [ 58 ]. The researchers found no association between B-vitamin supplementation and cancer outcomes. In a combined analysis of two trials in Norway (where foods are not fortified with folic acid), supplementation with 800 mcg/day folic acid plus 400 mcg/day vitamin B12 for a median of 39 months in 3,411 people with ischemic heart disease increased cancer incidence rates by 21% and cancer mortality rates by 38% compared with no supplementation [ 59 ]. Findings from these Norwegian trials have raised concerns about folic acid supplementation’s potential to raise cancer risk.\nThe most thorough research has focused on folate’s effect on the development of colorectal cancer and its precursor, adenoma [ 1 , 55 , 60 ]. Several epidemiological studies have found inverse associations between high dietary folate intakes and the risk of colorectal adenoma and cancer [ 61-64 ]. For example, in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, a cohort study of more than 525,000 people age 50 to 71 years in the United States, individuals with total folate intakes of 900 mcg/day or higher had a 30% lower risk of colorectal cancer than those with intakes lower than 200 mcg/day [ 62 ]. Other studies, however, have found no significant associations between dietary folate intakes [ 65 , 66 ] or circulating folate concentrations [ 67 , 68 ] and colorectal cancer risk.\nSeveral clinical trials have examined whether supplemental folic acid (sometimes in combination with other B-vitamins) reduces the risk of colorectal adenoma in individuals with or without a history of adenoma. In the Women’s Antioxidant and Folic Acid Cardiovascular Study, which included 1,470 older women at high risk of cardiovascular disease, daily supplementation with 2,500 mcg folic acid, 50 mg vitamin B6, and 1,000 mcg vitamin B12 did not affect rates of colorectal adenoma during 7.3 years of intervention and about 2 years of postintervention follow-up [ 69 ]. A pooled analysis of three large clinical trials (one in Canada, one in both the United States and Canada, and one in both the United Kingdom and Denmark) found that folic acid supplementation for up to 3.5 years neither increased nor decreased adenoma recurrence rates in people with a history of adenoma [ 70 ]. However, in one of the studies included in the analysis, folic acid supplementation (1,000 mcg/day) significantly increased the risks of having three or more adenomas and of noncolorectal cancers, although it had no effect on colorectal cancer risk [ 71 ].\nFolic acid supplementation also had no effect on the risk of all cancer types combined in the pooled analysis of three clinical trials cited above [ 70 ]. Similarly, a meta-analysis of 13 randomized trials showed no statistically significant effects of folic acid supplementation (median daily dose of 2,000 mcg) over an average treatment period of 5.2 years on overall cancer incidence or the incidence of colorectal, lung, breast, prostate, or other cancers [ 72 ].\nSome research has found associations between folic acid supplementation and increased cancer risk. In a randomized clinical trial investigating osteoporotic fracture incidence in 2,919 participants age 65 years or older with elevated homocysteine levels, those who received 400 mcg folic acid plus 500 mcg vitamin B12 and 600 International Units (IU) vitamin D3 for 2 years reported a significantly higher cancer incidence, especially of colorectal and other gastrointestinal cancers, than those who received only 600 IU vitamin D3 [ 73 ]. In addition, a 2018 prospective study found that folic acid intake from fortified foods and supplements was positively associated with a risk of cancer recurrence among 619 patients with non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer, whereas natural folate intakes showed no significant association [ 74 ]. Higher plasma folate concentrations have also been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation [ 75 ]. A secondary analysis of the study by Cole and colleagues [ 71 ] found that folic acid supplementation significantly increased the risk of prostate cancer [ 76 ] . Subsequent research has shown an association between increased cancer cell proliferation and higher serum folate concentrations in men with prostate cancer [ 77 ]. A meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials that included a total of 25,738 men found that the risk of prostate cancer was 24% higher in men receiving folic acid supplements than those taking a placebo [ 78 ].\nThe mixed findings from clinical trials, combined with evidence from laboratory and animal studies indicating that high folate status promotes tumor progression, suggest that folate might play dual roles in cancer risk, depending on the dosage and timing of the exposure. Modest doses of folic acid taken before preneoplastic lesions are established might suppress cancer development in healthy tissues, whereas high doses taken after the establishment of preneoplastic lesions might promote cancer development and progression [ 9 , 60 , 79-82 ]. This hypothesis is supported by a 2011 prospective study that found an inverse association between folate intake and risk of colorectal cancer only during early preadenoma stages [ 83 ].\nA 2015 expert panel convened by the National Toxicology Program and the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements concluded that folic acid supplements do not reduce cancer risk in people with adequate baseline folate status. The panel also determined that the consistent findings from human studies that supplemental folic acid has an adverse effect on cancer growth justify additional research on the effects of folic acid supplementation on cancer risk [ 84 ]. Several important questions about these effects remain, including the dose and timing of folic acid supplementation that might exert tumor-promoting effects and whether this effect is specific to synthetic folic acid or other forms of folate [ 57 ].\nOverall, the evidence to date indicates that adequate dietary folate intake might reduce the risk of some forms of cancer. However, the effects of supplemental folic acid on cancer risk are unclear, especially among individuals with a history of colorectal adenomas or other forms of cancer. More research is needed to fully understand how dietary folate and supplemental folic acid affect cancer risk and whether their effects differ by timing of exposure.\n\n",

    "Cardiovascular disease and stroke": "An elevated homocysteine level has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease [ 1 , 2 ]. Folate and other B vitamins are involved in homocysteine metabolism, and researchers have hypothesized that these micronutrients reduce cardiovascular disease risk by lowering homocysteine levels [ 1 , 85 ].\nFolic acid (and vitamin B12) supplements lower homocysteine levels. However, these supplements do not actually decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease, although they appear to provide protection from stroke [ 85-94 ]. For example, in 5,442 U.S. women age 42 or older who were at high risk of cardiovascular disease, daily supplements containing 2,500 mcg folic acid, 1 mg vitamin B12, and 50 mg vitamin B6 for 7.3 years did not reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events [ 89 ]. In a substudy of 300 participants, the supplementation also had no significant effects on biomarkers of vascular inflammation [ 91 ], but it did lower homocysteine levels by a mean of 18.5% [ 89 ]. Another clinical trial included 5,522 patients age 55 years or older with vascular disease or diabetes from various countries (including the United States and Canada) that had a folic acid fortification program and some that did not [ 88 ]. Patients received 2,500 mcg folic acid plus 50 mg vitamin B6 and 1 mg vitamin B12 or placebo for an average of 5 years. Compared with placebo, treatment with B vitamins significantly decreased homocysteine levels but did not reduce the risk of death from cardiovascular causes or myocardial infarction. Supplementation did, however, significantly reduce the risk of stroke by 25%.\nIn a large trial in regions of China without folic acid fortification among 20,702 adults with hypertension but no history of stroke or myocardial infarction, supplementation with 800 mcg folic acid plus 10 mg enalapril (used to treat high blood pressure) for a median of 4.5 years significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 21% compared with enalapril alone [ 92 ]. The effect was more pronounced in participants with the lowest baseline levels of plasma folate. An analysis of 10,789 participants from this trial found that folic acid supplementation significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 73% among those who had a low platelet count and an elevated homocysteine level (increasing their risk of stroke) but had no significant effect on participants with a high platelet count and low homocysteine level [ 95 ]. These findings suggest that folic acid supplementation might primarily benefit those with insufficient folate levels, which are less common in countries, such as the United States, with folic acid fortification [ 96 ].\nThe authors of a 2012 meta-analysis of 19 randomized controlled trials that included 47,921 participants concluded that B-vitamin supplementation has no effect on the risk of cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, or cardiovascular death, although it does reduce the risk of stroke by 12% [ 86 ]. Likewise, the authors of the third update of a Cochrane Review of the effects of homocysteine-lowering interventions on cardiovascular events concluded that folic acid supplementation alone or in combination with vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 does not affect the risk of myocardial infarction or death from any cause, but it does reduce the risk of stroke [ 97 ]. Three other meta-analyses have also found that folic acid is effective for preventing stroke, especially in populations exposed to no or partial folic acid fortification [ 94 , 98 , 99 ].\nOverall, the available evidence suggests that supplementation with folic acid alone or in combination with other B-vitamins reduces the risk of stroke, especially in populations with low folate status, but does not affect other cardiovascular endpoints.\n\n",

    "Depression": "Low folate status has been linked to depression and poor response to antidepressants in some, but not all, studies. The possible mechanisms are unclear but might be related to folate’s role in methylation reactions in the brain, neurotransmitter synthesis, and homocysteine metabolism [ 117 , 118 ]. However, secondary factors linked to depression, such as unhealthy eating patterns and alcohol use disorder, might also contribute to the observed association between low folate status and depression [119.\nIn an ethnically diverse population study of 2,948 people age 15 to 39 years in the United States, serum and erythrocyte folate concentrations were significantly lower in individuals with major depression than in those who had never been depressed [ 119 ]. An analysis of 2005–2006 NHANES data found that higher serum concentrations of folate were associated with a lower prevalence of depression in 2,791 adults age 20 or older [ 117 ]. The association was statistically significant in females, but not in males. However, another analysis showed no associations between folate intakes from both food and dietary supplements and depression among 1,368 healthy Canadians age 67–84 years [ 118 ]. Results from a study of 52 men and women with major depressive disorder showed that only 1 of 14 participants with low serum folate levels responded to antidepressant treatment compared with 17 of 38 with normal folate levels [ 120 ].\nA few studies have examined whether folate status affects the risk of depression during pregnancy or after childbirth. A systematic review of these studies had mixed results [ 121 ]. One study included in the review among 709 women in Singapore found that compared with women with higher plasma folate concentrations (mean 40.4 nmol/L [17.8 ng/mL]) at 26–28 weeks’ gestation, those with lower plasma folate concentrations (mean 27.3 nmol/L [12.0 ng/mL]) had a significantly higher risk of depression during pregnancy but not after giving birth [ 122 ]. Another study of 2,856 women in the United Kingdom found no significant associations between red blood cell folate levels or folate intakes from food and dietary supplements before or during pregnancy and postpartum depressive symptoms [ 123 ]. More recently, a cohort study of 1,592 Chinese women found a lower prevalence of postpartum depression in women who took folic acid supplements for more than 6 months during pregnancy than in those who took them for less time [ 124 ].\nStudies have had mixed results on whether folic acid supplementation might be a helpful adjuvant treatment for depression when used with traditional antidepressant medications. In a clinical trial in the United Kingdom, 127 patients with major depression were randomly assigned to receive either 500 mcg folic acid or placebo in addition to 20 mg of fluoxetine daily for 10 weeks [ 125 ]. Although the effects in men were not statistically significant, women who received fluoxetine plus folic acid had a significantly greater improvement in depressive symptoms than those who received fluoxetine plus placebo. Another clinical trial in the United Kingdom randomized 475 adults with moderate to severe depression who were taking antidepressant medications to either 5,000 mcg folic acid or placebo daily for 12 weeks in addition to their antidepressants [ 126 ]. Measures of depression did not improve in participants taking folic acid compared with those taking placebo. The authors of a systematic review and meta-analysis of four trials of folic acid (<5,000 mcg/day in two trials; 5,000 mcg/day in two trials) in combination with fluoxetine or other antidepressants in patients with major depressive disorder concluded that less than 5,000 mcg/day folic acid might be beneficial as an adjunct to serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) therapy [ 127 ]. The authors noted, however, that this conclusion was based on low-quality evidence. Another meta-analysis of four clinical trials found that 500–10,000 mcg folic acid per day for 6–12 weeks as an adjunctive treatment did not significantly affect measures of depression compared with placebo [ 128 ].\nOther studies have examined the effects of 5-MTHF supplementation as an adjuvant treatment to antidepressants, and results suggest that it might have more promise than folic acid [ 127-130 ]. In a clinical trial in 148 adults with major depressive disorder, supplementation with 7,500 mcg/day 5-MTHF for 30 days followed by 15,000 mcg/day for another 30 days, both in conjunction with SSRI treatment, did not improve measures of depression compared with SSRI treatment plus placebo [ 131 ]. However, in a subsequent trial with the same study design in 75 adults, supplementation with 15,000 mcg/day 5-MTHF plus SSRI treatment for the full 60 days did significantly improve depression compared with SSRI treatment plus placebo [ 131 ].\nThe authors of a systematic review and meta-analysis of three trials of 5-MTHF (<15,000 mcg/day in one trial, and 15,000 mcg/day in two trials) in combination with fluoxetine or other antidepressants, concluded that 15,000 mcg/day 5-MTHF might be an effective adjunct to SSRI therapy in patients with major depressive disorder, although they noted that this conclusion was based on low-quality evidence [ 127 ]. In addition, evidence-based guidelines from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [ 129 ] and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments [ 130 ] state that 5-MTHF might be effective as an adjunct to SSRI treatment for depressive disorders.\nAdditional research is needed to fully understand the association between folate status and depression. Although limited evidence suggests that supplementation with certain forms and doses of folate might be a helpful adjuvant treatment for depressive disorders, more research is needed to confirm these findings. In addition, many of the doses of folate used in studies of depression exceed the UL and should be taken only under medical supervision.\n\n",

    "Folate Intakes and Status": "According to data from the 2013–2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), most people in the United States consume adequate amounts of folate. Mean dietary intakes of folate from foods range from 417 to 547 mcg DFE per day for children age 2–19 [ 28 ]. Average daily intakes of folate from food are 602 mcg DFE for males age 20 and older and 455 mcg DFE for females.\nAlthough most people consume adequate amounts of folate, certain groups, including women of childbearing age and non-Hispanic black women, are at risk of insufficient folate intakes. Even when intakes of folic acid from dietary supplements are included, 19% of female adolescents age 14 to 18 years and 17% of women age 19 to 30 years do not meet the EAR [ 29 ]. Similarly, 23% of non-Hispanic black women have inadequate total intakes, compared with 13% of non-Hispanic white women.\nAbout 35% of adults and 28% of children age 1 to 13 years in the United States use supplements containing folic acid [ 29 , 30 ]. Adults age 51 to 70 years are more likely than members of other age groups to take supplements containing folic acid. Use is also higher among non-Hispanic whites than non-Hispanic blacks or Mexican Americans. People age 2 years and older who take supplements containing folic acid get a mean of 712 mcg DFE from those supplements [ 28 ].\nMeasurements of erythrocyte folate levels also suggest that most people in the United States have adequate folate status. According to an analysis of NHANES 2003–2006 data, less than 0.5% of children age 1 to 18 years have deficient erythrocyte folate concentrations [ 18 ]. Mean concentrations in this age group range from 211 to 294 ng/mL depending on age, dietary habits, and supplement use. In adults, mean erythrocyte folate concentrations range from 216 to 398 ng/mL, also indicating adequate folate status [ 31 ].\nSome population groups are at risk of obtaining excessive folic acid. About 5% of men and women age 51–70 and men age 71 and older have folic acid intakes exceeding the UL of 1,000 mcg per day, primarily because of the folic acid they obtain from dietary supplements [ 29 ]. Furthermore, 30% to 66% of children age 1 to 13 years who take folic acid-containing supplements have intakes of folic acid from both fortified food and dietary supplements exceeding the UL of 300–600 mcg per day [ 30 ]. Almost all children age 1 to 8 years who consume at least 200 mcg/day folic acid from dietary supplements have total intakes that exceed the UL [ 18 ]. Little is known about the long-term effects of high folic acid doses in children [ 7 ].\n",
    "Folate Deficiency": "Isolated folate deficiency is uncommon; folate deficiency usually coexists with other nutrient deficiencies because of its strong association with poor diet, alcoholism, and malabsorptive disorders [ 4 ]. Megaloblastic anemia, which is characterized by large, abnormally nucleated erythrocytes, is the primary clinical sign of folate or vitamin B12 deficiency [ 1 , 4 ]. Its symptoms include weakness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, headache, heart palpitations, and shortness of breath [ 2 ].\nFolate deficiency can also produce soreness in and shallow ulcerations on the tongue and oral mucosa; changes in skin, hair, or fingernail pigmentation; gastrointestinal symptoms; and elevated blood concentrations of homocysteine [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 32 ].\nWomen with insufficient folate intakes are at increased risk of giving birth to infants with NTDs [ 2 ]. Inadequate maternal folate status has also been associated with low infant birth weight, preterm delivery, and fetal growth retardation [ 1 , 33 ].\n",
    "Groups at Risk of Folate Inadequacy": "Frank folate deficiency is rare in the United States, but some individuals might have marginal folate status. The following groups are among those most likely to be at risk of folate inadequacy.\n",
    "People with alcohol use disorder": "People with alcohol use disorder frequently have poor-quality diets that contain insufficient amounts of folate. Moreover, alcohol interferes with folate absorption and hepatic uptake, accelerates folate breakdown, and increases its renal excretion [ 1 , 4 , 9 ]. An evaluation in Portugal, where the food supply is not fortified with folic acid, found low folate status in more than 60% of people with chronic alcoholism [ 34 ]. Even moderate alcohol consumption of 240 ml (8 fluid ounces) red wine per day or 80 ml (2.7 fluid ounces) vodka per day for 2 weeks can significantly decrease serum folate concentrations in healthy men, although not to levels below the cutoff for folate adequacy of 3 ng/ml [ 35 ].\n",
    "Women of childbearing age": "All women and adolescents who are capable of becoming pregnant should obtain adequate amounts of folate to reduce the risk of NTDs and other birth defects [ 2 , 36 , 37 ]. However, some women of childbearing age get insufficient amounts of folate even if they take dietary supplements [ 29 ]. Women of childbearing age should obtain 400 mcg/day folic acid from dietary supplements and/or fortified foods in addition to the folate provided by a varied diet [ 2 ].\n",
    "People with malabsorptive disorders": "Several medical conditions increase the risk of folate deficiency. People with malabsorptive disorders—including tropical sprue, celiac disease, and inflammatory bowel disease—might absorb less folate than people without these disorders [ 4 ]; for example, about 20%–60% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease have folate deficiency [ 39 ]. Diminished gastric acid secretion associated with atrophic gastritis, gastric surgery, and other conditions can also reduce folate absorption [ 4 ].\n",
    "People with an MTHFR polymorphism": "People with a genetic polymorphism, 677C>T, in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene have a reduced ability to convert folate to one of its active forms, 5-MTHF, because the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase enzyme needed for this conversion is less active [ 21 ]. About 25% of Hispanics, 10% of Caucasians and Asians, and 1% of African Americans are homozygous for the 677C>T MTHFR polymorphism [ 27 ]. This polymorphism results in less biologically available 5-MTHF and, thus, reduced methylation potential, leading to elevated homocysteine levels and an increased risk of NTDs [ 1 , 3 , 20 , 40 ]. Although the research on the benefits of folate supplementation for people with this genetic polymorphism is inconclusive, some of these people might benefit from supplementation with 5-MTHF [ 20 , 21 ]. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends 400 mcg/day of folic acid, not 5-MTHF, for people who could become pregnant, even if they have a 677C>T MTHFR polymorphism (see Neural tube defects below) [ 41 ].\n",
    "Folate and Health": "This section focuses on seven diseases and disorders in which folate might play a role: autism spectrum disorder ; cancer ; cardiovascular disease and stroke ; dementia, cognitive function, and Alzheimer’s disease ; depression ; NTDs ; and preterm birth, congenital heart defects, and other congenital anomalies .\n\n",
    "Autism spectrum disorder": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulty communicating and interacting with other people, limited interests, and repetitive behaviors. The classification and diagnosis of ASD was changed in 2013 to include conditions previously known as autistic disorder, Asperger’s syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified [ 42 ]. The causes of ASD are not clear, but genetic and environmental factors (including infections) and prenatal exposure to certain drugs, pollutants, and pesticides are believed to play a role [ 43-46 ].\nEmerging evidence suggests that periconceptional folic acid supplementation might reduce the risk of ASD or mitigate the potentially increased risk of ASD from prenatal exposure to certain drugs and toxic chemicals. The mechanism of these potential benefits is unknown, but it might be related to folic acid’s role in DNA methylation, which, in turn, can affect neurodevelopment [ 47-49 ].\nSome, but not all, observational studies have shown associations between maternal use of folic acid and/or multivitamin supplements before and/or during pregnancy and lower risk of ASD in the women’s offspring. For example, the prospective Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study that included 85,176 children age 3.3 to 10.2 years found that children of mothers who took up to 400 mcg per day folic acid during all or part of the time from 4 weeks before to 8 weeks after the start of pregnancy were 39% less likely to have autistic disorder than those whose mothers did not take the supplements [ 50 ]. The results showed no significant associations, however, between supplementation and Asperger’s syndrome or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. In a U.S. population-based, case-control study of 837 children, those born to mothers who consumed a mean of 600 mcg folic acid per day or more from supplements and fortified breakfast cereals during the first month of pregnancy had a 38% lower risk of ASD than those of mothers who consumed less than 600 mcg per day [ 51 ]. This association was strongest for mothers and children with the 677C>T MTHFR polymorphism. Similarly, a 2018 case-control cohort study of 45,300 Israeli children demonstrated a significantly decreased risk of ASD in children of mothers who took folic acid and/or multivitamin supplements before and/or during pregnancy [ 52 ]. Conversely, a longitudinal, population-based cohort of 35,059 pregnant Danish women and their children found no association between periconceptional folic acid or multivitamin use and ASD [ 53 ].\nPericonceptional use of folic acid might mitigate the potentially increased risk of ASD in children exposed to certain drugs and neurotoxins in utero [ 44-46 ]. An analysis of data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, which included 104,946 children, found that children exposed to antiepileptic drugs (known to reduce folate in vivo) in utero were 5.9 to 7.9 times more likely to have autistic traits at age 18 and 36 months if their mothers did not take folic acid periconceptionally than if they did [ 44 ]. In addition, the severity of autistic traits was inversely associated with both maternal plasma folate concentrations and folic acid doses. Similarly, in a U.S. study of 712 children, mothers exposed to any indoor pesticide during pregnancy who had folic acid intakes of 800 mcg or more per day during the first month of pregnancy were 1.7 times more likely to have a child with ASD than women with the same folic acid intakes who were not exposed to indoor pesticides [ 45 ]. The risk of ASD was even higher (2.5 times) if the women were exposed to indoor pesticides and had daily folic acid intakes of less than 800 mcg, suggesting that folic acid might attenuate the potentially increased risk of ASD from pesticide exposure.\nOverall, the evidence to date suggests a possible inverse association between mothers’ periconceptional folic acid intakes and risk of ASD in their offspring. However, most, if not all, of the currently available data are observational, and confounding weakens the ability to demonstrate causal inference. Additional research and validation in other studies are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.\n\n",
    "Dementia, cognitive function, and Alzheimer’s disease": "Most observational studies conducted to date have shown positive associations between elevated homocysteine levels and the incidence of both Alzheimer’s disease and dementia [ 32 , 79 , 100-104 ]. Scientists hypothesize that elevated homocysteine levels might have a negative effect on the brain via numerous mechanisms, including cerebrovascular ischemia leading to neuronal cell death, activation of tau kinases leading to tangle deposition, and inhibition of methylation reactions [ 103 ]. Some, but not all, observational studies have also found correlations between low serum folate concentrations and both poor cognitive function and higher risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease [ 79 , 100 , 101 , 103 , 105 ].\nDespite this evidence, most clinical trial research has not shown that folic acid supplementation affects cognitive function or the development of dementia or Alzheimer’s disease, even though supplementation lowers homocysteine levels. In one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in the Netherlands, 195 people age 70 years or older with no or moderate cognitive impairment received 400 mcg folic acid plus 1 mg vitamin B12; 1 mg vitamin B12; or placebo for 24 weeks [ 106 ]. Treatment with folic acid plus vitamin B12 reduced homocysteine concentrations by 36% but did not improve cognitive function. In another clinical trial in older adults (mean age 74.1 years) with elevated homocysteine levels, supplementation with 400 mcg folic acid plus 500 mcg vitamin B12 and 600 IU vitamin D3 for 2 years lowered homocysteine levels but did not affect cognitive performance compared with 600 IU vitamin D3 alone [ 107 ].\nAs part of the Women’s Antioxidant and Folic Acid Cardiovascular Study, 2,009 U.S. women age 65 years or older at high risk of cardiovascular disease were randomly assigned to receive daily supplements containing 2,500 mcg folic acid plus 1 mg vitamin B12 and 50 mg vitamin B6 or placebo [ 108 ]. After an average of 1.2 years, B-vitamin supplementation did not affect mean cognitive change from baseline compared with placebo. However, in a subset of women with a low baseline dietary intake of B vitamins, supplementation significantly slowed the rate of cognitive decline. In a trial that included 340 individuals in the United States with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease, daily supplements of 5,000 mcg folic acid plus 1 mg vitamin B12 and 25 mg vitamin B6 for 18 months did not slow cognitive decline compared with placebo [ 109 ].\nA secondary analysis of a study in Australia (which did not have mandatory folic acid fortification at the time of the study) found that daily supplementation with 400 mcg folic acid plus 100 mcg vitamin B12 for 2 years improved some measures of cognitive function, particularly memory, in 900 adults age 60 to 74 years who had depressive symptoms [ 110 ]. Another meta-analysis included 11 randomized controlled trials in more than 20,000 older adults (mean age 60–82 years) that administered 400 to 2,500 mcg folic acid plus 20–1,000 mcg vitamin B12 in 10 trials and 3–50 mg vitamin B6 in 8 trials for 0.3 to 7.1 years. The supplementation significantly lowered homocysteine levels but did not affect cognitive aging, global cognitive function, or specific cognitive domains (including memory, speed, and executive function) [ 111 ].\nSeveral large reviews have evaluated the effect of B vitamins on cognitive function. Most of the authors concluded that supplementation with folic acid alone or in combination with vitamins B12 or B6 does not appear to improve cognitive function in individuals with or without cognitive impairment [ 112-115 ]. Some noted, however, that when researchers took baseline homocysteine and B-vitamin status into account, B-vitamin supplementation slowed cognitive decline in individuals at high risk of cognitive decline [ 103 , 104 ]. For example, one trial in the Netherlands administered either 800 mcg folic acid or placebo daily for 3 years to 818 participants age 50–70 years with elevated homocysteine levels (13 micromol/L or higher) and normal vitamin B12 levels [ 116 ]. Folic acid supplementation reduced homocysteine concentrations by 26% and significantly improved global cognitive function, memory, and information processing speed compared with placebo, but it did not affect sensorimotor speed, complex speed, or word fluency.\nAdditional clinical trials are needed to better understand the effects of folic acid supplementation on cognitive function and cognitive decline.\n\n",
    "Neural tube defects": "NTDs result in malformations of the spine (spina bifida), skull, and brain (anencephaly). They are the most common major congenital malformations of the central nervous system and result from a failure of the neural tube to close at either the upper or lower end on days 21 to 28 after conception [ 132 , 133 ]. The prevalence rate of spina bifida and anencephaly (the two most common types of NTDs) in the United States is 5.5 to 6.5 per 10,000 births [ 134 ].\nBecause of its role in the synthesis of DNA and other critical cell components, folate is especially important during phases of rapid cell growth [ 135 ]. Although the mechanism has not been fully established, clinical trial evidence shows that adequate periconceptional folic acid consumption by women prevents a substantial proportion of NTDs [ 3 , 81 , 132 , 133 , 136 , 137 ].\nSince 1998, when mandatory folic acid fortification began in the United States, NTD rates have declined by 28% [ 134 ]. However, significant racial and ethnic disparities persist. NTD prevalence rates are highest among Hispanic women and lowest among non-Hispanic black women. Factors that might contribute to these disparities include differences in dietary and supplement-taking practices [ 138 ] as well as factors other than folate status—such as maternal diabetes, obesity, and intake of other nutrients (e.g., vitamin B12)—which are also believed to affect the risk of NTDs [ 132 , 137 , 139-141 ]. In addition, women with the 677C>T MTHFR polymorphism—which is more common in Hispanics than Caucasians, Asians, and African Americans—might have an increased risk of NTDs [ 1 , 3 , 27 , 40 ]. Another consideration is the fact that the data on NTD prevalence rates were collected before 2016, when FDA approved the voluntary addition of folic acid to corn masa flour [ 15 ], an ingredient commonly consumed by Hispanic populations. Whether this policy change has affected the disparities in NTD rates between Hispanic women and other populations is not yet known.\nBecause approximately 50% of pregnancies in the United States are unplanned, adequate folate status is especially important during the periconceptional period before a woman might be aware that she is pregnant. The FNB advises all women and adolescents who are capable of becoming pregnant to “consume 400 mcg of folic acid daily from supplements, fortified foods, or both in addition to consuming food folate from a varied diet” [ 2 ]. The U.S. Public Health Service and CDC have published similar recommendations [ 36 ]. Consuming 400 mcg/day folic acid helps prevent NTDs, even in women with the 677C>T MTHFR polymorphism [ 41 ].\nThe authors of a 2017 systematic review concluded that folic acid supplementation protected users from NTDs in studies conducted before food fortification with folic acid began in the United States [ 142 ]. Although studies conducted since that time do not demonstrate a clear protective association (possibly because of food fortification effects, study design flaws, or inadequate sample sizes) [ 142 ], the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that all women and adolescents who are planning to become or capable of becoming pregnant take a daily supplement containing 400 to 800 mcg folic acid starting least 1 month before conception and continuing through the first 2 to 3 months of pregnancy [ 37 ].\nThe FNB has not issued recommendations for women who have given birth to a child with an NTD and plan to become pregnant again. However, other experts recommend that these women obtain 4,000 to 5,000 mcg supplemental folic acid daily starting at least 1 to 3 months before conception and continuing for 2½ to 3 months after conception [ 132 , 143 ]. These doses exceed the UL and should be taken only under medical supervision [ 143 ].\n\n",
    "Preterm birth, congenital heart defects, and other congenital anomalies": "According to observational studies, folic acid supplementation might increase mean gestational age and lower the risk of preterm birth [ 1 , 144 ]. In addition, folic acid in combination with a multivitamin supplement helps minimize the risk of congenital heart defects, possibly because cardiac tissue development depends on cells that require large amounts of folate [ 1 , 2 , 132 ].\nThe authors of a large population-based cohort study of about 98% of all births in Canada from 1990 to 2011 concluded that folic acid fortification of foods was associated with an 11% reduction in the rate of nonchromosomal congenital heart defects [ 145 ]. In a population-based case-control study in Atlanta involving 3,987 infants, congenital heart defects were 24% less common in the infants of women who took multivitamins containing folic acid during the periconceptional period than in the infants of women who did not [ 146 ]. A case-control study in California in 866 infants had similar results [ 147 ]. However, it is not possible to determine whether the findings from these studies could be attributed to components of multivitamins other than folic acid.\nStudies have also found associations between the use of folic acid in combination with multivitamin supplements and reduced occurrence at birth of urinary tract anomalies, oral facial clefts, limb defects, and hydrocephalus, but the results of these studies have been inconsistent [ 2 , 132 ].\nAdditional research is needed to fully understand the extent to which maternal consumption of folic acid might affect the risk of these adverse birth outcomes. However, folic acid’s established role in preventing NTDs—and possibly other birth defects—underscores its importance during the periconceptional period.\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Folate": "Large amounts of folate can correct the megaloblastic anemia, but not the neurological damage, that can result from vitamin B12 deficiency. Some experts have therefore been concerned that high intakes of folate supplements might mask vitamin B12 deficiency until its neurological consequences become irreversible. Questions about this possibility still remain, but the focus of concern has shifted to the potential for large amounts of folate to precipitate or exacerbate the anemia and cognitive symptoms associated with vitamin B12 deficiency [ 2 , 85 , 148-153 ].\nConcerns have also been raised that high folic acid intakes might accelerate the progression of preneoplastic lesions, increasing the risk of colorectal and possibly other cancers in certain individuals [ 1 , 3 , 60 , 80 , 81 ]. In addition, intakes of 1,000 mcg per day or more of folic acid from supplements during the periconception period have been associated with lower scores on several tests of cognitive development in children at age 4–5 years than in children of mothers who took 400 mcg to 999 mcg [ 154 ].\nIntakes of folic acid that exceed the body’s ability to reduce it to THF lead to unmetabolized folic acid in the body, which has been linked to reduced numbers and activity of natural killer cells, suggesting that it could affect the immune system [ 5 , 155 ]. In addition, some scientists have hypothesized that unmetabolized folic acid might be related to cognitive impairment among older adults [ 156 ]. These potential negative health consequences are not well understood and warrant further research [ 1 , 9 ].\nStudies have found unmetabolized folic acid in blood from children, adolescents, and adults [ 1 , 5 , 157 , 158 ]; breastmilk [ 159 ]; and cord blood from newborns [ 160 , 161 ]. Limited research suggests that single doses of 300 mcg or 400 mcg folic acid (a common amount in folic acid-containing supplements or servings of fortified foods, such as breakfast cereals) result in detectable serum levels of unmetabolized folic acid, whereas doses of 100 mcg or 200 mcg do not [ 162 , 163 ]. In addition, a dose-frequency interaction appears to occur in which smaller amounts of folic acid consumed more frequently produce higher unmetabolized folic acid concentrations than the same total dose consumed in larger, less frequent amounts [ 164 ].\nBased on the metabolic interactions between folate and vitamin B12, the FNB established a UL for the synthetic forms of folate available in dietary supplements and fortified foods (Table 3) [ 2 ]. The FNB did not establish a UL for folate from food because high intakes of folate from food sources have not been reported to cause adverse effects [ 2 ]. Thus, unlike the RDAs, the ULs are in mcg, not mcg DFE. For folic acid, 1,000 mcg is equivalent to 1,667 mcg DFE because 0.6 mcg folic acid = 1 mcg DFE [ 11 , 164 ]. The ULs do not apply to individuals taking high doses of supplemental folate under medical supervision [ 2 ].\n* Breast milk, formula, and food should be the only sources of folate for infants.\n",
    "Methotrexate": "Methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall), used to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases, is a folate antagonist. Patients taking methotrexate for cancer should consult their oncologist before taking folate supplements because the supplements could interfere with methotrexate’s anticancer effects [ 166 ]. However, folate supplements might reduce the gastrointestinal side effects of low-dose methotrexate taken for rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis [ 167 , 168 ].\n",
    "Sulfasalazine": "Sulfasalazine (Azulfidine) is used primarily to treat ulcerative colitis. It inhibits the intestinal absorption of folate and can cause folate deficiency [ 170 ]. Patients taking sulfasalazine should ask their health care provider whether they should increase their dietary folate intake, start taking a folate supplement, or both [ 166 ].\n",
    "Folate and Healthful Diets": "The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Many fruits and vegetables are good sources of folate. In the United States, bread, cereal, flour, cornmeal, pasta, rice, and other grain products are fortified with folic acid. Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. Beef liver contains high amounts of folate. Peas, beans, nuts, and eggs also have folate. Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Limits alcoholic beverages. Stays within your daily calorie needs.\nMany fruits and vegetables are good sources of folate.

    "Introduction": "Iodine is a trace element that is naturally present in some foods, is added to some types of salt, and is available as a dietary supplement. Iodine is an essential component of the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Thyroid hormones regulate many important biochemical reactions, including protein synthesis and enzymatic activity, and are critical determinants of metabolic activity [ 1 , 2 ]. They are also required for proper skeletal and central nervous system development in fetuses and infants [ 1 ].\nThyroid function is primarily regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), also known as thyrotropin. It is secreted by the pituitary gland to control thyroid hormone production and secretion, thereby protecting the body from hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism [ 1 ]. TSH secretion increases thyroidal uptake of iodine and stimulates the synthesis and release of T3 and T4. In the absence of sufficient iodine, TSH levels remain elevated, leading to goiter, an enlargement of the thyroid gland that reflects the body’s attempt to trap more iodine from the circulation and produce thyroid hormones. Iodine may have other physiological functions in the body as well. For example, it appears to play a role in immune response and might have a beneficial effect on mammary dysplasia and fibrocystic breast disease [ 2 ].\nThe earth’s soils contain varying amounts of iodine, which in turn affects the iodine content of crops. In some regions of the world, iodine-deficient soils are common, increasing the risk of iodine deficiency among people who consume foods primarily from those areas. Salt iodization programs, which many countries have implemented, have dramatically reduced the prevalence of iodine deficiency worldwide [ 2 , 3 ].\nIodine in food and iodized salt is present in several chemical forms including sodium and potassium salts, inorganic iodine (I2), iodate, and iodide, the reduced form of iodine [ 4 ]. Iodine rarely occurs as the element but rather as a salt; for this reason, it is referred to as iodide and not iodine. Iodide is quickly and almost completely absorbed in the stomach and duodenum. Iodate is reduced in the gastrointestinal tract and absorbed as iodide [ 2 , 5 ]. When iodide enters the circulation, the thyroid gland concentrates it in appropriate amounts for thyroid hormone synthesis and most of the remaining amount is excreted in the urine [ 2 ]. The iodine-replete healthy adult has about 15–20 mg of iodine, 70%–80% of which is contained in the thyroid [ 6 ].\nMedian urinary iodine concentrations of 100–199 mcg/L in children and adults, 150–249 mcg/L in pregnant women and >100 mcg/L in lactating women indicate iodine intakes are adequate [ 3 ]. Values lower than 100 mcg/L in children and nonpregnant adults indicate insufficient iodine intake, although iodine deficiency is not classified as severe until urinary iodine levels are lower than 20 mcg/L.\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for iodine and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies (formerly National Academy of Sciences) [ 2 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and gender [ 2 ], include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nTable 1 lists the current RDAs for iodine [ 2 ]. For infants from birth to 12 months, the FNB established an AI for iodine that is equivalent to the mean intake of iodine in healthy, breastfed infants in the United States.\n* Adequate Intake (AI)\nThe World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children’s Fund, and the International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders recommend a slightly higher iodine intake for pregnant women of 250 mcg per day [ 3 , 7 ].\n",
    "Food": "Seaweed (such as kelp, nori, kombu, and wakame) is one of the best food sources of iodine [ 5 ]. Other good sources include fish and other seafood as well as eggs (see Table 2). Iodine is also present in human breast milk [ 2 , 5 ] and infant formulas [ 8 ].\nDairy products contain iodine. However, the amount of iodine in dairy products varies by whether the cows received iodine feed supplements and whether iodophor sanitizing agents were used to clean the cows and milk-processing equipment [ 9 ]. For example, an analysis of 59 samples of nonfat milk found a range of 38 to 160 mcg per cup (with an average of 84 mcg/cup used for Table 2) [ 8 ]. Plant-based beverages used as milk substitutes, such as soy and almond beverages, contain relatively small amounts of iodine.\nMost commercially prepared bread contains very little iodine unless the manufacturer has used potassium iodate or calcium iodate as a dough conditioner [ 10 , 11 ]. Manufacturers list dough conditioners as an ingredient on product labels but are not required to include iodine on the Nutrition Facts label [ 12 ], even though these conditioners provide a substantial amount of iodine. According to 2019 data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Branded Food Products Database, approximately 20% of ingredient labels for white bread, whole-wheat bread, hamburger buns, and hot dog buns listed iodate [ 13 ]. Pasta is not a source of iodine unless it is prepared in water containing iodized salt because it absorbs some of the iodine [ 11 ].\nMost fruits and vegetables are poor sources of iodine, and the amounts they contain are affected by the iodine content of the soil, fertilizer use, and irrigation practices [ 2 , 10 ]. This variability affects the iodine content of meat and animal products because of its impact on the iodine content of foods that the animals consume [ 14 ]. The iodine amounts in different seaweed species also vary greatly. For example, commercially available seaweeds in whole or sheet form have iodine concentrations ranging from 16 mcg/g to 2,984 mcg/g [ 15 ]. For these reasons, the values for the foods listed in Table 2 are approximate but can be used as a guide for estimating iodine intakes.\n*DV = Daily Value. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for iodine is 150 mcg for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 12 ]. FDA does not require food labels to list iodine content unless iodine has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. **About 20% of bread products in the United States list iodate dough conditioners on their labels. Products made without these conditioners contain very little iodine.\nThe USDA, FDA, and ODS-NIH Database for the Iodine Content of Common Foods [ 8 ] lists the iodine content of numerous foods and beverages.\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "In dietary supplements, iodine is often present as potassium iodide or sodium iodide [ 20 ]. Supplements containing kelp, a seaweed that contains iodine, are also available. A small study found that people absorb potassium iodide almost completely (96.4%) [ 21 ].\nMany multivitamin/mineral supplements contain iodine, often at a dose of 150 mcg [ 20 ], and some, but not all, prenatal supplements contain iodine [ 22 ]. Dietary supplements containing only iodine are also available, and many contain high doses, sometimes above the UL [ 20 ]. Many dietary supplements that contain iodine are listed in the Dietary Supplement Label Database from the NIH [ 20 ]. This database contains label information from tens of thousands of dietary supplement products on the U.S. market.\n",

    "Iodized salt": "The United States, Canada, and dozens of other countries have salt-iodization programs [ 3 , 16 , 17 ]. In the United States, salt manufacturers have been adding iodine to table salt since the 1920s, although this practice is still voluntary [ 18 ]. FDA has approved the use of potassium iodide and cuprous iodide for salt iodization [ 19 ], whereas the WHO recommends the use of potassium iodate due to its greater stability, particularly in warm, damp, or tropical climates [ 3 ]. According to its label, iodized salt in the United States contains 45 mcg iodine/g salt (between 1/8 and 1/4 teaspoon); measured salt samples have an average of 47.5–50.7 mcg iodine/g salt [ 8 , 18 ]. However, most salt intake in the United States comes from processed foods, and food manufacturers almost always use noniodized salt in these foods. If they do use iodized salt, they must list the salt as iodized in the ingredient list on the food label [ 9 ]. Specialty salts, such as sea salt, kosher salt, Himalayan salt, and fleur de sel, are not usually iodized. Product labels will indicate if the salt is iodized or provides iodide. As shown in Table 2, noniodized sea salt provides virtually no iodine [ 8 ].\n",
    "Iodine intakes": "The Total Diet Study (TDS), an FDA monitoring program, provides estimated iodine intakes of the U.S. population [ 23 ]. Through the TDS program, foods that represent the average U.S. diet are purchased and analyzed for several components, including iodine. Based on analytical results from TDS food samples collected between 2008 and 2012, combined with food consumption estimates, the average daily iodine intake in the United States was 216 mcg/day, with a range from 141 to 296 mcg/day across all age and gender groups [ 24 ]. These intakes meet or exceed the EAR for all groups.\nTDS data do not include iodine that people obtain from the discretionary use of iodized salt [ 25 , 26 ]. Because many U.S. households use iodized salt, TDS data likely underestimate the true iodine intake of most U.S. residents. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) collected between 1999 and 2004 indicate that 28–29% of adults use iodine-containing dietary supplements [ 27 ]; this use also adds to the population’s total iodine intake.\n",
    "Iodine status of the general U.S. population": "Iodine status is typically assessed using urinary iodine measurements. Urinary iodine reflects dietary iodine intake directly because people excrete more than 90% of dietary iodine in the urine [ 4 ]. Spot urine iodine measurements are a useful indicator of iodine status within populations [ 28 , 29 ]. However, multiple 24-hour urinary iodine or multiple spot urine measurements are more accurate for individuals [ 4 , 30 ].\nMedian urinary iodine concentrations, from spot samples collected as part of a large survey, can be used to characterize the iodine status of populations [ 31 ]. However, because spot samples are not a suitable indicator of individual iodine status [ 30 ], these measurements cannot be used to diagnose individual cases of iodine deficiency or to identify the proportion of a population with iodine deficiency or with excessive iodine intakes [ 31 ]. For a population of school-age children or nonpregnant adults to be iodine sufficient, median urinary iodine concentrations should be greater than 100 mcg/L and no more than 20% of the population should have values lower than 50 mcg/L [ 3 ].\nUrinary iodine measurements from NHANES have been used since 1971 to monitor the iodine status of the U.S. population [ 32 ]. Since the inception of the NHANES monitoring program, urinary iodine measurements have shown that the general U.S. population is iodine sufficient. This is despite the fact that urinary iodine levels decreased by more than 50% between 1971–1974 and 1988–1994 [ 2 , 33 ]. Much of this decline was a result of decreased levels of iodine in milk due to the reduced use of iodine-containing feed supplements and iodophor sanitizing agents in the dairy industry [ 34 ] as well as the reduced use of iodate dough conditioners by commercial bakers. The use of erythrosine, an iodine-containing food dye commonly used in fruit-flavored breakfast cereals, also decreased during this time [ 34 ] though it is unclear to what extent this change actually affected urinary iodine levels because the bioavailability of iodine from erythrosine has been found to be low [ 35 ]. This sharp decline in urinary iodine levels caused some concern during the late 1990s that the iodine sufficiency of the U.S. population could be at risk if this trend continued [ 33 ].\nMore recent NHANES measurements indicate that urinary iodine levels have stabilized in the general U.S. population. During 2007–2008, NHANES participants age 6 years and older had a median urinary iodine concentration of 164 mcg/L [ 36 ]. Among women of reproductive age, the median urinary iodine concentration in NHANES 2007–2014 was 119 mcg/L [ 37 ]. These values have essentially remained unchanged in the last three NHANES surveys, indicating that the dietary iodine intake of the general U.S. population has remained stable since 2000 [ 36 ].\n",
    "Iodine status of U.S. pregnant women": "According to the WHO, a median urinary iodine concentration of 150–249 mcg/L indicates adequate iodine nutrition during pregnancy, while values less than 150 mcg/L are considered insufficient [ 3 , 7 ]. Analyses of NHANES datasets from 2003 to 2014 indicate that a substantial portion of pregnant women in the United States are iodine insufficient. Median urinary iodine concentrations for pregnant women participating in NHANES surveys were 181 mcg/L in 2003–2004, 153 mcg/L in 2001–2006, 125 mcg/L in 2005–2008, and 144 mcg/L in 2007–2014 [ 32 , 36-38 ]. Suboptimal iodine status during pregnancy has also been observed in Australia [ 39 ].\nPregnant women who do not consume dairy products may be particularly at risk of iodine insufficiency. According to NHANES 2001–2006 data, pregnant women who consumed no dairy products in the previous 24 hours had a median urinary iodine concentration of only 100 mcg/L, compared with 163 mcg/L among consumers of dairy [ 38 ]. Women who restrict their dietary salt intake also have lower urinary iodine concentrations and might be more likely to be iodine deficient than women who don’t restrict salt intake [ 40 ].\nOverall, it appears that the general U.S. population has adequate iodine intake but that some pregnant women may be at risk for iodine deficiency. Continued national iodine monitoring is needed with more emphasis on population subgroups that are most susceptible to iodine deficiency disorders.\n",
    "Iodine Deficiency": "Iodine deficiency has multiple adverse effects on growth and development and is the most common cause of preventable intellectual disability in the world [ 41 ]. Iodine deficiency disorders result from inadequate thyroid hormone production secondary to insufficient iodine [ 5 ]. During pregnancy and early infancy, iodine deficiency can cause irreversible effects.\nUnder normal conditions, the body tightly controls thyroid hormone concentrations via TSH. Typically, TSH secretion increases when iodine intake falls below about 100 mcg/day [ 5 ]. TSH increases thyroidal iodine uptake from the blood and the production of thyroid hormone. However, very low iodine intakes can reduce thyroid hormone production even in the presence of elevated TSH levels. In addition, it is important to note that TSH concentration may remain within the normal range when iodine intake is low, so TSH is not a sensitive indicator of iodine deficiency [ 5 ].\nIf a person’s iodine intake falls below approximately 10–20 mcg/day, hypothyroidism occurs [ 1 ], a condition that is frequently accompanied by goiter. Goiter is usually the earliest clinical sign of iodine deficiency [ 2 ]. In pregnant women, iodine deficiency of this magnitude can cause major neurodevelopmental deficits and growth retardation in the fetus as well as miscarriage and stillbirth [ 5 ]. Chronic, severe iodine deficiency in utero causes cretinism, a condition characterized by intellectual disability, deaf mutism, motor spasticity, stunted growth, delayed sexual maturation, and other physical and neurological abnormalities [ 5 ].\nIn infants and children, less severe iodine deficiency can also cause neurodevelopmental deficits such as somewhat lower than average intelligence as measured by IQ [ 1 , 42 , 43 ]. Mild to moderate maternal iodine deficiency has also been associated with an increased risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children [ 44 ]. In adults, mild to moderate iodine deficiency can cause goiter as well as impaired mental function and work productivity secondary to hypothyroidism. Chronic iodine deficiency may be associated with an increased risk of the follicular form of thyroid cancer [ 45 ].\n",
    "Groups at Risk of Iodine Inadequacy": "Historically, iodine deficiency was endemic in mountainous regions of the United States and Mexico, and in the so called goiter belt around the Great Lakes [ 46 ]. Thanks to a more national food supply, iodized salt, and other factors, overt iodine deficiency is now uncommon in North America. International efforts since the early 1990s have dramatically reduced the incidence of iodine deficiency worldwide, but some groups of people are still at risk of inadequate iodine intake. Iodine insufficiency remains a public health problem in 25 countries with a total population of about 683 million people [ 47 ]. The following groups are among those most likely to have inadequate iodine status.\n",
    "People who do not use iodized salt": "The use of iodized salt is the most widely used strategy to control iodine deficiency. Currently, about 88% of households worldwide use iodized salt, but iodine insufficiency is still prevalent in certain regions, particularly Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Eastern Europe [ 47 , 48 ].\n",
    "Vegans and people who eat few or no dairy products, seafood, and eggs": "Seafood, eggs, milk, and milk products are among the best sources of iodine. Vegans, people with certain food allergies or lactose intolerance, and others who consume no or minimal amounts of these foods might not obtain sufficient amounts of iodine [ 49 , 50 ].\n",
    "People living in regions with iodine-deficient soils": "Iodine-deficient soils produce crops that have low iodine levels. Mountainous areas (e.g., Himalayas, Alps, and Andes regions) and river valleys prone to flooding (especially in South and Southeast Asia) are among the most iodine-deficient regions in the world [ 5 ]. People living in these areas are at risk of iodine deficiency unless they consume iodized salt or foods produced outside the iodine-deficient area.\n",
    "People with marginal iodine status who eat foods containing goitrogens": "Consumption of foods that contain goitrogens, substances that interfere with the uptake of iodine in the thyroid, can exacerbate iodine deficiency [ 2 ]. Foods high in goitrogens include soy, cassava, and cruciferous vegetables (e.g., cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower). Deficiencies of iron and/or vitamin A may also be goitrogenic [ 51 ]. These issues are of concern primarily for people living in areas prone to iodine deficiency [ 6 ]. For most people, including most of the U.S. population, who have adequate iodine intakes and eat a variety of foods, the consumption of reasonable amounts of foods containing goitrogens is not a concern.\n",
    "Iodine and Health": "Due to its important role in fetal and infant development and thyroid hormone production, iodine is a critical nutrient for proper health at all life stages. This section focuses on four areas of biomedical research examining iodine’s role in health and disease: fetal and infant development, cognitive function during childhood, fibrocystic breast disease, and radiation-induced thyroid cancer. It also includes a section on low iodine diets, which are usually recommended for patients preparing to undergo radioactive iodine treatment.\n",
    "Fetal and infant development": "Iodine sufficiency during pregnancy is extremely important for proper fetal development. During early pregnancy, when fetal thyroid gland development is incomplete, the fetus depends entirely on maternal T4 and, therefore, on maternal iodine intake [ 52 ]. Production of T4 increases by approximately 50% during pregnancy [ 53 ], requiring a concomitant increase in maternal iodine intake. Sufficient iodine intake after birth is also important for proper physical and neurological growth and maturation.\nResearch suggests that infants are more sensitive to the effects of iodine deficiency than other age groups, as indicated by changes in their TSH and T4 levels in response to even mild iodine deficiency [ 54 ]. Although severe iodine deficiency disorders are uncommon in the United States, mild to moderate iodine insufficiency during pregnancy may subtly affect fetal development [ 4 , 55-59 ]. A meta-analysis of 6,180 mother-child pairs from three birth cohorts in the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom found that verbal IQ assessed in children at 1.5 to 8 years of age was lower if their mothers had lower iodine status in their first trimester of pregnancy [ 43 ]. To accommodate increased iodine needs during pregnancy and lactation, the iodine RDA is 220 mcg/day for pregnant women and 290 mcg/day for lactating women [ 2 ]. Similarly, the WHO recommends 250 mcg/day during pregnancy and lactation [ 3 ].\nDespite the importance of iodine for proper fetal development, the effects of iodine supplements during pregnancy on infant and child neurodevelopment in particular are inconclusive. Two randomized clinical trials had a similar study design in which iodine was provided from early pregnancy to delivery (150 or 200 mcg/day iodine as potassium iodide) and assessed child cognition using the same tool at age 1.5 or 2 years [ 60 , 61 ]. Iodine supplementation had no effect on child cognitive, language, or motor scores [ 62 ]. One of these trials also assessed children at age 5–6 years and continued to find no benefit on child neurodevelopment from the mother’s use of iodine [ 60 ].\nBreast milk contains iodine, although concentrations vary based on maternal iodine levels. Infants who are exclusively breastfed depend on maternal iodine sufficiency for optimal development. In a study of 57 healthy lactating women from the Boston area, median breast milk iodine content was 155 mcg/L [ 63 ]. Based on reported infant iodine needs and the typical volume of breast milk consumed, the authors calculated that 47% of the women may have been providing their infants breast milk containing insufficient amounts of iodine. During the weaning period, infants not receiving iodine-containing complementary foods may also be at risk of iodine deficiency, even in countries with iodized salt programs [ 64 , 65 ].\nTo ensure that adequate amounts of iodine are available for proper fetal and infant development, several national and international groups recommend iodine supplementation during pregnancy, lactation, and early childhood. For women living in countries with weak, sporadic, or uneven iodized salt distribution, the WHO recommends iodine supplementation for all women of childbearing age to achieve a total iodine intake of 150 mcg/day. For pregnant and lactating women in these countries, iodine intakes of 250 mcg/day from both supplements and dietary sources are recommended [ 3 , 7 ]. WHO recommendations for these countries also include breastfeeding through 24 months of age, combined with complementary foods fortified with iodine for children between the ages of 7–24 months [ 7 ].\nThe American Thyroid Association recommends that women who are planning a pregnancy, currently pregnant, or lactating should supplement their diet with 150 mcg/day iodine in the form of potassium iodide [ 66 ]. Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that women who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or lactating take a daily supplement providing at least 150 mcg iodine and use iodized salt [ 67 ].\nThe use of iodine-containing dietary supplements by pregnant and lactating women in the United States appears to be low compared to current recommendations. Of 59 best-selling prenatal multivitamin supplements on the market in 2016–2017, only 34 contained iodine [ 22 ]. The median iodine content was 150 mcg per daily serving, with a range of 25 to 290 mcg; 25 of the 34 provided iodine as potassium iodide. According to 2011–2014 NHANES data, 72.2% of pregnant woman took any dietary supplement, but only 17.8% of them took an iodine-containing product [ 68 ]. Among lactating women, 75% took a dietary supplement, but only 19% of them took an iodine-containing product.\nResults from a 2010 study, however, raise some questions as to the safety of widespread iodine supplementation in areas of relative iodine sufficiency. In this cross-sectional study, pregnant women living in Spain had a significantly increased risk of hyperthyrotropinemia (TSH >3 microU/mL) if they consumed iodine supplements in doses ≥200 mcg/day compared with those who consumed doses <100 mcg/day [ 69 ]. These findings suggest that taking higher doses of supplemental iodine during pregnancy could induce thyroid dysfunction in some women and underscore the need for additional research into the effects on maternal thyroid function of iodine supplementation during pregnancy.\nTaken as a whole, these findings indicate that increased public awareness of iodine’s importance during pregnancy and lactation is warranted and that further research into the effects of iodine supplementation during pregnancy is needed. Many researchers, as well as the American Thyroid Association, stress the importance of continued iodine status monitoring among women of reproductive age [ 1 , 4 , 32 , 38 , 56 , 70 , 71 ].\n",
    "Cognitive function during childhood": "The effects of severe iodine deficiency on neurological development are well documented. Results from several studies suggest, for example, that chronic, moderate to severe iodine deficiency, particularly in children, reduces IQ by about 12–13.5 points [ 53 ]. A 2004 Cochrane Review concluded that iodine supplementation in children living in areas of iodine deficiency appears to both positively affect physical and mental development and decrease mortality with only minor and transient adverse effects [ 72 ].\nThe effects of mild iodine deficiency during childhood are more difficult to quantify. Some research suggests that mild iodine deficiency is associated with subtle neurodevelopmental deficits and that iodine supplementation might improve cognitive function in mildly iodine-deficient children [ 52 ].\nIn a 2009 randomized, placebo-controlled study, 184 children age 10–13 years in New Zealand with a median urinary iodine concentration of 63 mcg/L received iodine supplements (150 mcg/day) or placebo for 28 weeks [ 73 ]. Iodine supplementation improved iodine status (median urinary iodine concentration after supplementation was 145 mcg/L) and significantly improved measures of perceptual reasoning and overall cognitive score compared with children taking a placebo. These findings suggest that correcting mild iodine deficiency in children could improve certain components of cognition. Additional research is required to fully understand the effects of mild iodine deficiency and iodine supplementation on cognitive function.\n",
    "Fibrocystic breast disease": "Fibrocystic breast disease is a benign condition characterized by lumpy, painful breasts and palpable fibrosis. It commonly affects women of reproductive age, but it can also occur during menopause, especially in women taking estrogens [ 74 ]. Breast tissue has a high concentration of iodine, especially during pregnancy and lactation [ 4 , 75 ]. Some research suggests that iodine supplementation might be helpful for fibrocystic breast disease, although a specific mechanism of action has not been established [ 76 ] and data are limited.\nIn a double-blind study, researchers randomly assigned 56 women with fibrocystic breast disease to receive daily supplements of iodine (70 to 90 mcg I2/kg body weight) or placebo for 6 months [ 74 ]. At treatment completion, 65% of the women receiving iodine reported decreased pain compared with 33% of women in the placebo group. A more recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial had similar findings. In this study, researchers randomly assigned 111 women (18–50 years of age) with fibrosis and a history of breast pain to receive tablets containing 0 mcg, 1,500 mcg, 3,000 mcg, or 6,000 mcg of iodine per day [ 76 ]. After 5 months of treatment, women receiving doses of 3,000 or 6,000 mcg iodine had a significant decrease in breast pain, tenderness, and nodularity compared with those receiving placebo or 1,500 mcg iodine. The researchers also reported a dose-dependent reduction in self-assessed pain. None of the doses was associated with major adverse events or changes in thyroid function test results.\nAlthough the results of these studies are promising, more research is needed to clarify iodine’s role in fibrocystic breast disease. Moreover, the doses used in these studies (approximately 1,500–6,000 mcg per day) are several times higher than the iodine UL of 1,100 mcg for adults. Doses of this magnitude should only be used under the guidance of a physician [ 2 ].\n",
    "Radiation-induced thyroid cancer": "Nuclear accidents can release radioactive iodine into the environment, increasing the risk of thyroid cancer in exposed individuals, especially children [ 77 , 78 ]. Thyroidal uptake of radioactive iodine is higher in people with iodine deficiency than in people with iodine sufficiency. For this reason, iodine-deficient individuals have a particularly high risk of developing radiation-induced thyroid cancer when exposed to radioactive iodine.\nFDA has approved potassium iodide as a thyroid-blocking agent to reduce the risk of thyroid cancer in radiation emergencies involving the release of radioactive iodine [ 77 ]. FDA recommends that exposed people take a daily pharmacological dose (16–130 mg potassium iodide, depending on age) until the risk of significant radiation exposure ends [ 77 , 78 ]. Potassium iodide was widely used in Poland following the 1986 Chernobyl accident and childhood thyroid cancer rates did not increase substantially in subsequent years [ 79 ]. In areas where iodide prophylaxis was not used, such as Belarus and Ukraine, where many children were mildly iodine deficient, the incidence of thyroid cancer sharply increased among children and adolescents [ 77 ].\n",
    "Low iodine diets for radioactive iodine treatment": "Patients preparing to undergo radioactive iodine treatment for differentiated thyroid cancer are usually instructed to follow a low iodine diet prior to treatment. The rationale behind this guidance is to deplete iodine levels in the body and increase thyroidal uptake of the radioactive iodine (iodine–131) [ 80-82 ].\nA low iodine diet typically limits iodine intake to 50 mcg/day or less for 1 to 2 weeks before treatment [ 80-83 ]. Specific recommendations vary, however, and research is ongoing to define optimal guidelines for low iodine diets. For example, one study in an area of the Netherlands with sufficient iodine status found that following a low iodine diet for 4 days might adequately prepare patients for radioactive iodine treatment [ 84 ]. This study examined 24-hour urinary iodine excretion in 65 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer who followed a low iodine diet (less than 50 mcg/day) for 7 days. Iodine excretion on day 4 of the low iodine diet was not significantly different than that on day 7. However, the authors noted that following a low iodine diet for only 4 days might not be sufficient for people living in iodine-rich areas.\nPeople following a low iodine diet should avoid many foods, including iodized salt, fish and other seafood, seaweed, milk and milk products, liver, and eggs. They should also avoid bread and other grain products made with iodate dough conditioners, as well as maraschino cherries and some red or pink beverages because these products are often made with iodine-containing red dyes [ 8 , 82 , 85 ]. Foods that are relatively low in iodine include noniodized salt (including many sea salts), fruits and fruit juices, vegetables, plant-based milk substitutes (such as soy and almond beverages), rice, pasta, oatmeal, beans, nuts, poultry, pork, beef (except liver), and bread that does not contain iodate dough conditioners.\nNutrition Facts labels on foods do not usually list iodine unless the manufacturer has added iodine to the food. Therefore, Nutrition Facts labels cannot be relied upon to identify foods that naturally contain iodine, such as seaweed, fish, and other seafood.\nIodine is also present in some dietary supplements, including products containing kelp and many multivitamin/mineral supplements [ 20 ]. The Supplement Facts labels on dietary supplement products will indicate whether iodine is present and at what dose.\nPatients preparing for radioactive iodine treatment may develop hyponatremia, especially if they are undergoing thyroid hormone withdrawal [ 86 ]. To reduce the risk of hyponatremia, the American Thyroid Association notes that noniodized salt use should not be restricted when following a low iodine diet [ 83 ] . Other groups at risk for hyponatremia include people who are over 65 years of age, females, and those taking thiazide diuretics [ 82 ]. Noniodized salt is available in grocery stores. In addition, almost all salt used in processed foods in the United States is noniodized; product labels will indicate if the manufacturer used salt that is iodized or provides iodine [ 9 ].\nThe following resources may be helpful for clinicians and patients when planning low iodine diets to prepare for radioactive iodine treatment:\n“ Low Iodine Diet ” from the American Thyroid Association provides guidelines and menu options for meals and snacks. The USDA, FDA, and ODS-NIH Database for the Iodine Content of Common Foods lists the iodine content per serving and per 100-gram amounts of hundreds of foods and beverages. Includes food descriptions, as well as means, standard deviations, value ranges, sample sizes, and supporting documentation. “ Thyroid Cancer Treatment ” from the National Cancer Institute includes information on radioactive iodine therapy. “ Childhood Thyroid Cancer Treatment ” from the National Cancer Institute provides information about risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of different types of childhood thyroid cancer.\nDespite widespread recommendations to follow a low iodine diet prior to radioactive iodine treatment, results from studies examining the impact of this practice on treatment success are inconsistent [ 80 , 82 , 83 ]. The authors of a 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis of 56 quantitative and 3 qualitative studies concluded that low iodine diets reduce iodine status [ 87 ]. However, results were unclear on whether this improves the success of radioactive iodine treatment. In addition, studies have not examined whether following a low iodine diet to prepare for radioactive iodine treatment affects long-term disease recurrence or mortality [ 83 ].\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Iodine": "High intakes of iodine can cause some of the same symptoms as iodine deficiency—including goiter, elevated TSH levels, and hypothyroidism—because excess iodine in susceptible individuals inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis and thereby increases TSH stimulation, which can produce goiter [ 2 , 88 ]. Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism can also result from high iodine intakes, including when iodine is administered to treat iodine deficiency. Studies have also shown that excessive iodine intakes cause thyroiditis and thyroid papillary cancer [ 2 , 88 ]. Cases of acute iodine poisoning are rare and are usually caused by doses of many grams. Acute poisoning symptoms include burning of the mouth, throat, and stomach; fever; abdominal pain; nausea; vomiting; diarrhea; weak pulse; and coma [ 2 ].\nResponses to excess iodine and the doses required to cause adverse effects vary [ 89 ]. Some people, such as those with autoimmune thyroid disease and iodine deficiency, may experience adverse effects with iodine intakes considered safe for the general population [ 2 , 5 ].\nThe FNB has established iodine ULs for food and supplement intakes (Table 3). In most people, iodine intakes from foods and supplements are unlikely to exceed the UL [ 2 ]. Long-term intakes above the UL increase the risk of adverse health effects. The ULs do not apply to individuals receiving iodine for medical treatment, but such individuals should be under the care of a physician [ 2 ].\n* Formula and food should be the only sources of iodine for infants.\n",
    "Antithyroid medications": "Antithyroid medications, such as methimazole (Tapazole), are used to treat hyperthyroidism. Taking high doses of iodine with antithyroid medications can have an additive effect [ 89 ] and could cause hypothyroidism.\n",
    "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, such as benazepril (Lotensin), lisinopril (Prinivil and Zestril), and fosinopril (Monopril), are used primarily to treat high blood pressure. Taking potassium iodide with ACE inhibitors can increase the risk of hyperkalemia (elevated blood levels of potassium) [ 89 ].\n",
    "Potassium-sparing diuretics": "Taking potassium iodide with potassium-sparing diuretics, such as spironolactone (Aldactone) and amiloride (Midamor), can increase the risk of hyperkalemia [ 89 ].\n",
    "Iodine and Healthful Diets": "The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Milk and milk products contain iodine. Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. Some fish contain high amounts of iodine. Eggs are also good sources of iodine. Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Limits alcoholic beverages. Stays within your daily calorie needs.\nMilk and milk products contain iodine.\nSome fish contain high amounts of iodine. Eggs are also good sources of iodine.\n",

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet .\n",
    "Introduction": "Iron is a mineral that is naturally present in many foods, added to some food products, and available as a dietary supplement. Iron is an essential component of hemoglobin, an erythrocyte (red blood cell) protein that transfers oxygen from the lungs to the tissues [ 1 ]. As a component of myoglobin, another protein that provides oxygen, iron supports muscle metabolism and healthy connective tissue [ 2 ]. Iron is also necessary for physical growth, neurological development, cellular functioning, and synthesis of some hormones [ 2 , 3 ].\nDietary iron has two main forms: heme and nonheme [ 1 ]. Plants and iron-fortified foods contain nonheme iron only, whereas meat, seafood, and poultry contain both heme and nonheme iron [ 2 ]. Heme iron, which is formed when iron combines with protoporphyrin IX, contributes about 10% to 15% of total iron intakes in western populations [ 3-5 ].\nMost of the 3 to 4 grams of elemental iron in adults is in hemoglobin [ 2 ]. Much of the remaining iron is stored in the form of ferritin or hemosiderin (a degradation product of ferritin) in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow or is located in myoglobin in muscle tissue [ 1 , 5 ]. Transferrin is the main protein in blood that binds to iron and transports it throughout the body. Humans typically lose only small amounts of iron in urine, feces, the gastrointestinal tract, and skin. Losses are greater in menstruating women because of blood loss. Hepcidin, a circulating peptide hormone, is the key regulator of both iron absorption and the distribution of iron throughout the body, including in plasma [ 1 , 2 , 6 ].\nThe assessment of iron status depends almost entirely on hematological indicators [ 7 ]. However, these indicators are not sensitive or specific enough to adequately describe the full spectrum of iron status, and this can complicate the diagnosis of iron deficiency. A complementary approach is to consider how iron intakes from the diet and dietary supplements compare with recommended intakes.\nIron deficiency progresses from depletion of iron stores (mild iron deficiency), to iron-deficiency erythropoiesis (erythrocyte production), and finally to iron deficiency anemia (IDA) [ 8 , 9 ]. With iron-deficiency erythropoiesis (also known as marginal iron deficiency), iron stores are depleted and transferrin saturation declines, but hemoglobin levels are usually within the normal range. IDA is characterized by low hemoglobin concentrations, and decreases in hematocrit (the proportion of red blood cells in blood by volume) and mean corpuscular volume (a measure of erythrocyte size) [ 2 , 10 ].\nSerum ferritin concentration, a measure of the body's iron stores, is currently the most efficient and cost-effective test for diagnosing iron deficiency [ 11-13 ]. Because serum ferritin decreases during the first stage of iron depletion, it can identify low iron status before the onset of IDA [ 7 , 9 , 14 ]. A serum ferritin concentration lower than 30 mcg/L suggests iron deficiency, and a value lower than 10 mcg/L suggests IDA [ 15 ]. However, serum ferritin is subject to influence by inflammation (due, for example, to infectious disease), which elevates serum ferritin concentrations [ 16 ].\nHemoglobin and hematocrit tests are the most commonly used measures to screen patients for iron deficiency, even though they are neither sensitive nor specific [ 5 , 7 , 17 ]. Often, hemoglobin concentrations are combined with serum ferritin measurements to identify IDA [ 7 ]. Hemoglobin concentrations lower than 11 g/dL in children under 10 years of age, or lower than 12 g/dL in individuals age 10 years or older, suggest IDA [ 8 ]. Normal hematocrit values are approximately 41% to 50% in males and 36% to 44% in females [ 18 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for iron and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academies (formerly National Academy of Sciences) [ 5 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and gender, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nTable 1 lists the current iron RDAs for nonvegetarians. The RDAs for vegetarians are 1.8 times higher than for people who eat meat. This is because heme iron from meat is more bioavailable than nonheme iron from plant-based foods, and meat, poultry, and seafood increase the absorption of nonheme iron [ 5 ].\nFor infants from birth to 6 months, the FNB established an AI for iron that is equivalent to the mean intake of iron in healthy, breastfed infants.\n* Adequate Intake (AI)\n",
    "Food": "The richest sources of heme iron in the diet include lean meat and seafood [ 19 ]. Dietary sources of nonheme iron include nuts, beans, vegetables, and fortified grain products. In the United States, about half of dietary iron comes from bread, cereal, and other grain products [ 2 , 3 , 5 ]. Breast milk contains highly bioavailable iron but in amounts that are not sufficient to meet the needs of infants older than 4 to 6 months [ 2 , 20 ].\nIn the United States, Canada, and many other countries, wheat and other flours are fortified with iron [ 21 , 22 ]. Infant formulas are fortified with 12 mg iron per liter [ 20 ].\nHeme iron has higher bioavailability than nonheme iron, and other dietary components have less effect on the bioavailability of heme than nonheme iron [ 3 , 4 ]. The bioavailability of iron is approximately 14% to 18% from mixed diets that include substantial amounts of meat, seafood, and vitamin C (ascorbic acid, which enhances the bioavailability of nonheme iron) and 5% to 12% from vegetarian diets [ 2 , 4 ]. In addition to ascorbic acid, meat, poultry, and seafood can enhance nonheme iron absorption, whereas phytate (present in grains and beans) and certain polyphenols in some nonanimal foods (such as cereals and legumes) have the opposite effect [ 4 ]. Unlike other inhibitors of iron absorption, calcium might reduce the bioavailability of both nonheme and heme iron. However, the effects of enhancers and inhibitors of iron absorption are attenuated by a typical mixed western diet, so they have little effect on most people’s iron status.\nSeveral food sources of iron are listed in Table 2. Some plant-based foods that are good sources of iron, such as spinach, have low iron bioavailability because they contain iron-absorption inhibitors, such as polyphenols [ 23 , 24 ].\n* DV = Daily Value. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for iron is 18 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 26 ]. FDA requires food labels to list iron content. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) FoodData Central [ 25 ] lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing iron arranged by nutrient content and by food name .\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "Iron is available in many dietary supplements. Multivitamin/mineral supplements with iron, especially those designed for women, typically provide 18 mg iron (100% of the DV). Multivitamin/mineral supplements for men or seniors frequently contain less or no iron. Iron-only supplements usually deliver more than the DV, with many providing 65 mg iron (360% of the DV).\nFrequently used forms of iron in supplements include ferrous and ferric iron salts, such as ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate, ferric citrate, and ferric sulfate [ 3 , 27 ]. Because of its higher solubility, ferrous iron in dietary supplements is more bioavailable than ferric iron [ 3 ]. High doses of supplemental iron (45 mg/day or more) may cause gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea and constipation [ 5 ]. Other forms of supplemental iron, such as heme iron polypeptides, carbonyl iron, iron amino-acid chelates, and polysaccharide-iron complexes, might have fewer gastrointestinal side effects than ferrous or ferric salts [ 27 ].\nThe different forms of iron in supplements contain varying amounts of elemental iron. For example, ferrous fumarate is 33% elemental iron by weight, whereas ferrous sulfate is 20% and ferrous gluconate is 12% elemental iron [ 27 ]. Fortunately, elemental iron is listed in the Supplement Facts panel, so consumers do not need to calculate the amount of iron supplied by various forms of iron supplements.\nApproximately 14% to 18% of Americans use a supplement containing iron [ 28 , 29 ]. Rates of use of supplements containing iron vary by age and gender, ranging from 6% of children age 12 to 19 years to 60% of women who are lactating and 72% of pregnant women [ 28 , 30 ].\nCalcium might interfere with the absorption of iron, although this effect has not been definitively established [ 4 , 31 ]. For this reason, some experts suggest that people take individual calcium and iron supplements at different times of the day [ 32 ].\n",

    "Iron Intakes and Status": "People in the United States usually obtain adequate amounts of iron from their diets, but infants, young children, teenage girls, pregnant women, and premenopausal women are at risk of obtaining insufficient amounts [ 28 , 33-35 ]. The average daily iron intake from foods is 11.5–13.7 mg/day in children age 2–11 years, 15.1 mg/day in children and teens age 12–19 years, and 16.3–18.2 mg/day in men and 12.6–13.5 mg/day in women older than 19 [ 28 ]. The average daily iron intake from foods and supplements is 13.7–15.1 mg/day in children age 2–11 years, 16.3 mg/day in children and teens age 12–19 years, and 19.3–20.5 mg/day in men and 17.0–18.9 mg/day in women older than 19. The median dietary iron intake in pregnant women is 14.7 mg/day [ 5 ].\nRates of iron deficiency vary by race and other sociodemographic factors. Six percent of White and Black toddlers age 1 to 3 years in the United States are iron deficient (defined as at least two abnormal results for the child’s age and gender on transferrin saturation, free erythrocyte protoporphyrin, and/or serum ferritin tests), compared with 12% of Hispanic toddlers [ 36 ]. Deficiency (including IDA) is more common among children and adolescents in food-insecure households than in food-secure households [ 36 , 37 ]. Among pregnant women, deficiency based on depleted iron stores is more common in Mexican American (23.6%) and non-Hispanic Black women (29.6%) than in non-Hispanic White women (13.9%) [ 38 ].\nSome groups are at risk of obtaining excess iron. Individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis, which predisposes them to absorb excessive amounts of dietary iron, have an increased risk of iron overload [ 39 ]. One study suggests that elderly people are more likely to have chronic positive iron balance and elevated total body iron than iron deficiency. Among 1,106 elderly White adults age 67 to 96 years in the Framingham Heart Study, 13% had high iron stores (serum ferritin levels higher than 300 mcg/L in men and 200 mcg/L in women), of which only 1% was due to chronic disease [ 40 ]. The authors did not assess genotypes, so they could not determine whether these results were due to hemochromatosis [ 40 ].\n",
    "Iron Deficiency": "Iron deficiency is not uncommon in the United States, especially among young children, women of reproductive age, and pregnant women. Because iron deficiency is associated with poor diet, malabsorptive disorders, and blood loss, people with iron deficiency usually have other nutrient deficiencies [ 2 ]. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that approximately half of the 1.62 billion cases of anemia worldwide are due to iron deficiency [ 41 ]. In developing countries, iron deficiency often results from enteropathies and blood loss associated with gastrointestinal parasites [ 2 ].\nIron depletion and deficiency progresses through several stages [ 8-10 ]:\nIn 2002, the WHO characterized IDA as one of the 10 leading risk factors for disease around the world [ 42 ]. Although iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia, deficiencies of other micronutrients (such as folate and vitamin B12) and other factors (such as chronic infection and inflammation) can cause different forms of anemia or contribute to their severity.\nThe functional deficits associated with IDA include gastrointestinal disturbances; weakness; fatigue; difficulty concentrating; and impaired cognitive function, immune function, exercise or work performance, and body temperature regulation [ 15 , 43 ]. In infants and children, IDA can result in psychomotor and cognitive abnormalities that, without treatment, can lead to learning difficulties [ 2 , 43 ]. Some evidence indicates that the effects of deficiencies early in life persist through adulthood [ 2 ]. Because iron deficiency is often accompanied by deficiencies of other nutrients, the signs and symptoms of iron deficiency can be difficult to isolate [ 2 ].\n",
    "Groups at Risk of Iron Inadequacy": "The following groups are among those most likely to have inadequate intakes of iron.\n",
    "Infants and young children": "Infants—especially those born preterm or with low birthweight or whose mothers have iron deficiency—are at risk of iron deficiency because of their high iron requirements due to their rapid growth [ 34 , 45 ]. Full-term infants usually have sufficient iron stores and need little if any iron from external sources until they are 4 to 6 months old [ 2 ]. However, full-term infants have a risk of becoming iron deficient at 6 to 9 months unless they obtain adequate amounts of solid foods that are rich in bioavailable iron or iron-fortified formula.\n",
    "Women with heavy menstrual bleeding": "Women of reproductive age who have menorrhagia, or abnormally heavy bleeding during menstruation, are at increased risk of iron deficiency. At least 10% of menstruating women are believed to have menorrhagia, but the percentage varies widely depending on the diagnostic criteria used [ 46-48 ]. Women with menorrhagia lose significantly more iron per menstrual cycle on average than women with normal menstrual bleeding [ 49 ]. Limited evidence suggests that menorrhagia might be responsible for about 33% to 41% of cases of IDA in women of reproductive age [ 50 , 51 ].\n",
    "Frequent blood donors": "Frequent blood donors have an increased risk of iron deficiency [ 5 ]. In the United States, adults may donate blood as often as every 8 weeks, which can deplete iron stores. About 25%–35% of regular blood donors develop iron deficiency [ 52 ]. In a study of 2,425 blood donors, men who had given at least three and women who had given at least two whole-blood donations in the previous year were more than five times as likely to have depleted iron stores as first-time donors [ 53 ]. A clinical trial of iron supplementation found that of 215 adults who had donated a unit of blood within the past 3–8 days, those randomized to take an iron supplement (37.5 mg/day elemental iron from ferrous gluconate) for 24 weeks recovered their lost hemoglobin and iron in less than half the time of those not given the supplement [ 52 ]. Without iron supplementation, two-thirds of the donors had not recovered the iron they lost, even after 24 weeks.\n",
    "People with cancer": "Up to 60% of patients with colon cancer have iron deficiency at diagnosis, probably due to chronic blood loss [ 54 ]. The prevalence of iron deficiency in patients with other types of cancer ranges from 29% to 46%. The main causes of iron deficiency in people with cancer are anemia of chronic disease (discussed in the Iron and Health section below) and chemotherapy-induced anemia. However, chronic blood loss and deficiencies of other nutrients (due, for example, to cancer-induced anorexia) can exacerbate iron deficiency in this population.\n",
    "People who have gastrointestinal disorders or have had gastrointestinal surgery": "People with certain gastrointestinal disorders (such as celiac disease, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn’s disease) or who have undergone certain gastrointestinal surgical procedures (such as gastrectomy or intestinal resection) have an increased risk of iron deficiency because their disorder or surgery requires dietary restrictions or results in iron malabsorption or blood loss in the gastrointestinal tract [ 55-57 ]. The combination of low iron intake and high iron loss can lead to a negative iron balance; reduced production of hemoglobin; or microcytic, hypochromic anemia [ 58 ].\n",
    "People with heart failure": "Approximately 60% of patients with chronic heart failure have iron deficiency and 17% have IDA, which might be associated with a higher risk of death in this population [ 59 , 60 ]. Potential causes of iron deficiency in people with heart failure include poor nutrition; malabsorption; defective mobilization of iron stores; cardiac cachexia; and use of aspirin and oral anticoagulants, which might result in the loss of some blood in the gastrointestinal tract [ 61 ].\n",
    "Iron and Health": "This section focuses on the role of iron in IDA in pregnant women, infants, and toddlers as well as in anemia of chronic disease.\n",
    "Iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women": "Insufficient iron intakes during pregnancy increase a woman’s risk of IDA [ 62-65 ]. Low intakes also increase her infant’s risk of low birthweight, premature birth, low iron stores, and impaired cognitive and behavioral development.\nAn analysis of 1999–2006 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that 18% of pregnant women in the United States had iron deficiency [ 38 ]. Rates of deficiency were 6.9% among women in the first trimester,14.3% in the second trimester, and 29.7% in the third trimester.\nRandomized controlled trials have shown that iron supplementation can prevent IDA in pregnant women and related adverse consequences in their infants [ 66 , 67 ]. A Cochrane Review showed that daily supplementation with 9–90 mg iron reduced the risk of anemia in pregnant women at term by 70% and of iron deficiency at term by 57% [ 64 ]. In the same review, use of daily iron supplements was associated with an 8.4% risk of having a low-birthweight newborn compared to 10.2% with no supplementation. In addition, mean birthweight was 31 g higher for infants whose mothers took daily iron supplements during pregnancy compared with the infants of mothers who did not take iron.\nGuidelines on iron supplementation during pregnancy vary:\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends low-dose iron supplementation (dose not specified) starting in the first trimester to decrease the prevalence of maternal anemia at delivery [ 68 ]. It also recommends screening all pregnant women for anemia in the first trimester and again at 24 to 28 weeks gestation, and evaluating those who have anemia (defined as hematocrit levels less than 33% in the first and third trimesters and less than 32% in the second trimester) to determine the cause. ACOG states that IDA during pregnancy is associated with increased risks of preterm birth, low birth weight, and perinatal mortality and should be treated with iron supplementation in addition to prenatal vitamins. In contrast, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of both screening for iron deficiency and IDA in pregnant women and routinely supplementing them with iron to prevent adverse maternal and infant health outcomes [ 69 ]. They note, however, that their recommendation applies to asymptomatic pregnant women. It does not apply to pregnant women who are severely malnourished, have symptoms of iron deficiency or IDA, or have conditions such as sickle cell disease or nutritional deficiencies that may increase iron needs. The IOM notes that because the median intake of dietary iron by pregnant women is well below the EAR, pregnant women need iron supplementation [ 5 ]. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans advises that women who are pregnant take an iron supplement when recommended by an obstetrician or other health care provider [ 19 ]. It adds that low intakes of iron are a public health concern for pregnant women.\n",
    "Iron deficiency anemia in infants and toddlers": "Approximately 12% of infants age 6 to 11 months in the United States have inadequate iron intakes, and 8% of toddlers have iron deficiency [ 36 , 70 ]. The prevalence of IDA in U.S. toddlers age 12 to 35 months ranges from 0.9% to 4.4% depending on race or ethnicity and socioeconomic status [ 20 ]. Full-term infants typically have adequate iron stores for approximately the first 4 to 6 months, but the risk of iron deficiency in low-birthweight and preterm infants begins at birth because of their low iron stores.\nIDA in infancy can lead to adverse cognitive and psychological effects, including delayed attention and social withdrawal; some of these effects might be irreversible [ 2 , 20 ]. In addition, IDA is associated with higher lead concentrations in the blood (although the cause of this is not fully understood), which can increase the risk of neurotoxicity [ 20 ].\nA Cochrane Review of 26 studies in 2,726 preterm and low-birthweight infants found that enteral iron supplementation (at least 1 mg/kg/day) reduces the risk of iron deficiency, but the long-term effects of supplementation on neurodevelopmental outcomes and growth is not clear [ 71 ]. Another Cochrane Review of eight trials in 3,748 children younger than 2 in low-income countries showed that home fortification of semi-solid foods with micronutrient powders containing 12.5 mg to 30 mg elemental iron as ferrous fumarate and 4 to 14 other micronutrients for 2 to 12 months reduced rates of anemia by 31% and of iron deficiency by 51% compared with no intervention or placebo but had no effect on any growth measurements [ 72 ].\nGuidelines vary on dietary iron intakes and possible supplementation to ensure adequate iron status and to prevent or treat IDA in infants and young children:\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that infants less than 12 months of age who are not exclusively or primarily breastfed drink iron-fortified infant formula [ 17 ]. Breastfed infants who were born preterm or with a low birthweight should receive 2–4 mg/kg/day of iron drops (to a maximum of 15 mg/day) from ages 1–12 months. Breastfed infants who receive insufficient iron (less than 1 mg/kg/day) from supplementary foods by age 6 months should receive 1 mg/kg/day of iron drops. The CDC also recommends that infants and preschool children at high risk for IDA (e.g., children from low-income families and migrant children) be screened between age 9–12 months, 6 months later, and annually from age 2–5 years. Treatment for IDA begins with 3 mg/kg/day of iron drops given between meals. (See reference 17 for additional advice from the CDC.) The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends 1 mg/kg daily iron supplementation for exclusively or primarily breastfed full-term infants from age 4 months until the infants begin eating iron-containing complementary foods, such as iron-fortified cereals [ 20 ]. Standard infant formulas containing 10 to 12 mg/L iron can meet the iron needs of infants for the first year of life. The Academy recommends 2 mg/kg/day iron supplementation for preterm infants age 1 to 12 months who are fed breast milk. The WHO recommends universal supplementation with 2 mg/kg/day of iron in children age 6 to 23 months whose diet does not include foods fortified with iron or who live in regions (such as developing countries) where anemia prevalence is higher than 40% [ 44 ]. In a recommendation statement issued in 2015, the USPSTF concluded that the available evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against routine screening for IDA in children age 6 to 24 months who live in the United States and who are asymptomatic for IDA [ 73 ]. It added that this recommendation does not apply to severely malnourished children or children who were born prematurely or with low birthweight. Earlier, in 2006, the USPSTF stated that although it found insufficient evidence to recommend routine iron supplementation in asymptomatic infants at average risk of IDA, it did recommend routine iron supplements for children age 6 to 12 months who are at increased risk of IDA (e.g., those who were premature or low birthweight) [ 74 ]. The USPSTF's 2015 statement notes that its current recommendation is limited to screening because the widespread use of iron-fortified foods in the United States (including infant formulas and cereals) would likely limit the impact of iron supplementation prescribed by physicians [ 73 ].\nSome studies have suggested that iron supplementation in young children living in areas where malaria is endemic could increase their risk of malaria [ 75 , 76 ]. However, a Cochrane Review of 33 trials in 13,114 children showed that intermittent supplementation does not appear to have this effect [ 77 ]. The WHO therefore recommends 6-month supplementation cycles as follows: children age 24 to 59 months should receive 25 mg iron and those age 5 to 12 years should receive 45 mg every week for 3 months, followed by 3 months of no supplementation [ 75 ]. The WHO recommends providing these supplements in malaria-endemic areas in conjunction with measures to prevent, diagnose, and treat malaria.\n",
    "Anemia of chronic disease": "Certain inflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and hematologic malignancies) can cause anemia of chronic disease, also known as anemia of inflammation [ 2 , 78 ]. Anemia of chronic disease is the second most common type of anemia after IDA [ 79 ]. In people with anemia of chronic disease, inflammatory cytokines upregulate the hormone hepcidin. As a result, iron homeostasis is disrupted and iron is diverted from the circulation to storage sites, limiting the amount of iron available for erythropoiesis.\nAnemia of chronic disease is usually mild to moderate (hemoglobin levels 8 to 9.5 g/dL) and is associated with low counts of erythrocytes and decreased erythropoiesis [ 78 ]. The condition can be difficult to diagnose because, although low serum ferritin levels indicate iron deficiency, these levels tend to be higher in patients with infection or inflammation [ 80 ].\nThe clinical implications of iron deficiency in people with chronic diseases are not clear. Even mild anemia of chronic disease is associated with an increased risk of hospitalization and mortality in elderly people [ 81 ]. Two prospective observational studies found that iron deficiency in patients with objectively measured heart failure was associated with an increased risk of heart transplantation and death, and this association was independent of other well-established prognostic factors for poor outcomes, including anemia [ 82 , 83 ]. However, an analysis of NHANES data on 574 adults with self-reported heart failure found no association between iron deficiency and all-cause or cardiovascular mortality [ 60 ].\nThe main therapy for anemia of chronic disease is treatment of the underlying disease [ 79 ]. But when such treatment is not possible, iron supplementation and/or erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are sometimes used. The use of iron supplements—whether oral, intravenous, or parenteral—in this setting is controversial because they might increase the risk of infection and cardiovascular events and could cause tissue damage [ 79 ].\nOnly a few small studies have evaluated the benefits of oral iron supplementation alone or in combination with ESAs to treat anemia of chronic disease. For example, a prospective observational study in 132 patients with anemia and chronic kidney disease who were not on dialysis or ESAs found that oral supplements (130 mg/day elemental iron from ferrous sulfate twice daily) for 1 year resulted in a decline in hemoglobin of only 0.13 g/dL compared with 0.46 g/dL in the placebo group [ 76 , 84 ]. A randomized trial of oral iron supplements (equivalent to 200 mg/day elemental iron, form of iron not specified) taken with an ESA once weekly in 100 patients with cancer-related anemia resulted in a mean increase of 2.4 g/dL hemoglobin after 24 weeks compared with oral supplements only [ 85 ]. Iron administered parentally increases hemoglobin levels to a greater extent and is associated with fewer side effects than oral iron supplementation in patients with anemia of chronic disease [ 86 ].\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Iron": "Adults with normal intestinal function have very little risk of iron overload from dietary sources of iron [ 2 ]. However, supplements containing 25 mg iron or more can reduce zinc absorption and plasma zinc concentrations [ 3 , 87 , 88 ]. High-dose iron supplements can also cause gastrointestinal effects, including gastric upset, constipation, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea [ 5 , 89 ]. Taking iron supplements with food can help minimize these adverse effects. Case reports, some involving doses of 130 mg iron, suggest that some people develop even more serious gastrointestinal effects, including gastritis and gastric lesions (along with iron deposits in the gastric mucosa in some cases) [ 90-93 ].\nAcute intakes of more than 20 mg/kg iron (about 1,365 mg iron for a person weighing 150 lb) from supplements or medicines can lead to corrosive necrosis of the intestine, which might lead to fluid and blood loss, shock, tissue damage, and organ failure, especially if food is not taken at the same time as the iron [ 89 ]. In severe cases (e.g., one-time ingestions of 60 mg/kg, or about 4,090 mg iron for a 150-lb person), overdoses of iron can lead to multisystem organ failure, coma, convulsions, and even death [ 27 , 94 ].\nBetween 1983 and 2000, at least 43 U.S. children died from ingesting supplements containing high doses of iron (36–443 mg iron/kg body weight) [ 27 ]. Accidental ingestion of iron supplements caused about a third of poisoning deaths among children reported in the United States between 1983 and 1991.\nIn 1997, FDA began requiring oral supplements containing more than 30 mg elemental iron per dose to be sold in single-dose packaging with strong warning labels. At the same time, many manufacturers voluntarily replaced the sugar coating on iron tablets with film coatings. Between 1998 and 2002, only one child death due to ingesting an iron-containing tablet was reported [ 27 ]. As a result of a court decision, FDA removed its single-dose packaging requirement for iron supplements in 2003 [ 95 ]. FDA currently requires that iron-containing dietary supplements sold in solid form (e.g., tablets or capsules but not powders) carry the following label statement: “WARNING: Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Keep this product out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately” [ 96 ]. In addition, since 1978, the Consumer Product Safety Commission has required manufacturers to package dietary supplements containing 250 mg or more elemental iron per container in child-resistant bottles or packaging to prevent accidental poisoning [ 97 , 98 ].\nHemochromatosis, a disease caused by a mutation in the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene, is associated with an excessive buildup of iron in the body [ 3 , 39 , 99 ]. About 1 in 10 Whites carry the most common HFE mutation (C282Y), but only 4.4 Whites per 1,000 are homozygous for the mutation and have hemochromatosis [ 100 ]. The condition is much less common in other ethnic groups. Without treatment by periodic chelation or phlebotomy, people with hereditary hemochromatosis typically develop signs of iron toxicity by their 30s [ 3 ]. These effects can include liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, heart disease, and impaired pancreatic function. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommends that treatment of hemochromatosis include the avoidance of iron and vitamin C supplements [ 39 ].\nThe FNB has established ULs for iron from food and supplements based on the amounts of iron that are associated with gastrointestinal effects following supplemental intakes of iron salts (see Table 3). The ULs apply to healthy infants, children, and adults. Physicians sometimes prescribe intakes higher than the UL, such as when people with IDA need higher doses to replenish their iron stores [ 5 ].\n",
    "Levodopa": "Some evidence indicates that in healthy people, iron supplements reduce the absorption of levodopa (found in Sinemet and Stalevo), used to treat Parkinson’s disease and restless leg syndrome, possibly through chelation [ 101-103 ]. In the United States, the labels for levodopa warn that iron-containing dietary supplements might reduce the amount of levodopa available to the body and, thus, diminish its clinical effectiveness [ 104 , 105 ].\n",
    "Proton pump inhibitors": "Gastric acid plays an important role in the absorption of nonheme iron from the diet. Because proton pump inhibitors, such as lansoprazole (Prevacid) and omeprazole (Prilosec), reduce the acidity of stomach contents, they can reduce iron absorption [ 3 ]. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors for up to 10 years is not associated with iron depletion or anemia in people with normal iron stores [ 109 ] but patients with iron deficiency taking proton pump inhibitors can have suboptimal responses to iron supplementation [ 110 ].\n",
    "Iron and Healthful Diets": "The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Many ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are fortified with iron, and some fruits and vegetables contain iron. Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. Oysters and beef liver have high amounts of iron. Beef, cashews, chickpeas, and sardines are good sources of iron. Chicken, tuna, and eggs contain iron. Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Limits alcoholic beverages. Stays within your daily calorie needs.\nMany ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are fortified with iron, and some fruits and vegetables contain iron.\nOysters and beef liver have high amounts of iron.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet .\n",
    "Introduction": "Vitamin K, the generic name for a family of compounds with a common chemical structure of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in some foods and is available as a dietary supplement [ 1 ]. These compounds include phylloquinone (vitamin K1) and a series of menaquinones (vitamin K2) [ 2 ]. Menaquinones have unsaturated isoprenyl side chains and are designated as MK-4 through MK-13, based on the length of their side chain [ 1 , 2 ]. MK-4, MK-7, and MK-9 are the most well-studied menaquinones.\nPhylloquinone is present primarily in green leafy vegetables and is the main dietary form of vitamin K [ 3 ]. Menaquinones, which are predominantly of bacterial origin, are present in modest amounts in various animal-based and fermented foods [ 1 , 4 ]. Almost all menaquinones, in particular the long-chain menaquinones, are also produced by bacteria in the human gut [ 5 , 6 ]. MK-4 is unique in that it is produced by the body from phylloquinone via a conversion process that does not involve bacterial action [ 7 ].\nVitamin K functions as a coenzyme for vitamin K-dependent carboxylase, an enzyme required for the synthesis of proteins involved in hemostasis (blood clotting) and bone metabolism and other diverse physiological functions [ 3 , 5 ]. Prothrombin (clotting factor II) is a vitamin K-dependent protein in plasma that is directly involved in blood clotting. Warfarin (Coumadin) and some anticoagulants used primarily in Europe antagonize the activity of vitamin K and, in turn, prothrombin [ 8 ]. For this reason, individuals who are taking these anticoagulants need to maintain consistent vitamin K intakes.\nMatrix Gla-protein (MGP), a vitamin K-dependent protein present in vascular smooth muscle, bone, and cartilage, is the focus of considerable scientific research because it might help reduce abnormal calcification [ 9 ]. Osteocalcin is another vitamin K-dependent protein that is present in bone and may be involved in bone mineralization or turnover [ 5 ].\nLike dietary lipids and other fat-soluble vitamins, ingested vitamin K is incorporated into mixed micelles via the action of bile and pancreatic enzymes, and it is absorbed by enterocytes of the small intestine [ 10 ]. From there, vitamin K is incorporated into chylomicrons, secreted into the lymphatic capillaries, transported to the liver, and repackaged into very low-density lipoproteins [ 2 , 10 ]. Vitamin K is present in the liver and other body tissues, including the brain, heart, pancreas, and bone [ 2 , 3 , 11 ].\nIn the circulation, vitamin K is carried mainly in lipoproteins [ 2 ]. Compared to the other fat-soluble vitamins, very small amounts of vitamin K circulate in the blood. Vitamin K is rapidly metabolized and excreted. Based on phylloquinone measurements, the body retains only about 30% to 40% of an oral physiological dose, while about 20% is excreted in the urine and 40% to 50% in the feces via bile [ 2 , 11 ]. This rapid metabolism accounts for vitamin K's relatively low blood levels and tissue stores compared to those of the other fat-soluble vitamins [ 11 ].\nLittle is known about the absorption and transport of vitamin K produced by gut bacteria, but research indicates that substantial quantities of long-chain menaquinones are present in the large bowel [ 7 ]. Although the amount of vitamin K that the body obtains in this manner is unclear, experts believe that these menaquinones satisfy at least some of the body's requirement for vitamin K [ 6 , 7 ].\nIn most cases, vitamin K status is not routinely assessed, except in individuals who take anticoagulants or have bleeding disorders. The only clinically significant indicator of vitamin K status is prothrombin time (the time it takes for blood to clot), and ordinary changes in vitamin K intakes have rarely been shown to alter prothrombin time [ 5 ]. In healthy people, fasting concentrations of phylloquinone in plasma have been reported to range from 0.29 to 2.64 nmol/L [ 12 ]. However, it is not clear whether this measure can be used to quantitatively assess vitamin K status. People with plasma phylloquinone concentrations slightly below the normal range have no clinical indications of vitamin K deficiency, possibly because plasma phylloquinone concentrations do not measure the contribution of menaquinones from the diet and the large bowel [ 12 ]. No data on normal ranges of menaquinones are available [ 2 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for vitamin K and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies [ 3 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and gender, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nInsufficient data were available to establish an EAR for vitamin K, so the FNB established AIs for all ages that are based on vitamin K intakes in healthy population groups [ 3 ]. Table 1 lists the current AIs for vitamin K in micrograms (mcg). The AIs for infants are based on the calculated mean vitamin K intake of healthy breastfed infants and the assumption that infants receive prophylactic vitamin K at birth as recommended by American and Canadian pediatric societies [ 3 ].\n",
    "Food": "Food sources of phylloquinone include vegetables, especially green leafy vegetables, vegetable oils, and some fruits. Meat, dairy foods, and eggs contain low levels of phylloquinone but modest amounts of menaquinones [ 4 ]. Natto (a traditional Japanese food made from fermented soybeans) has high amounts of menaquinones [ 1 , 13 ]. Other fermented foods, such as cheese, also contain menaquinones. However, the forms and amounts of vitamin K in these foods likely vary depending on the bacterial strains used to make the foods and their fermentation conditions [ 14 ]. Animals synthesize MK-4 from menadione (a synthetic form of vitamin K that can be used in poultry and swine feed) [ 15 ]. Thus, poultry and pork products contain MK-4 if menadione is added to the animal feed [ 1 , 4 , 14 ].\nThe most common sources of vitamin K in the U.S. diet are spinach; broccoli; iceberg lettuce; and fats and oils, particularly soybean and canola oil [ 5 , 7 ]. Few foods are fortified with vitamin K [ 5 ]; breakfast cereals are not typically fortified with vitamin K, although some meal replacement shakes and bars are.\nData on the bioavailability of different forms of vitamin K from food are very limited [ 1 ]. The absorption rate of phylloquinone in its free form is approximately 80%, but its absorption rate from foods is significantly lower [ 2 ]. Phylloquinone in plant foods is tightly bound to chloroplasts, so it is less bioavailable than that from oils or dietary supplements [ 1 ]. For example, the body absorbs only 4% to 17% as much phylloquinone from spinach as from a tablet [ 2 ]. Consuming vegetables at the same time as some fat improves phylloquinone absorption from the vegetables, but the amount absorbed is still lower than that from oils. Limited research suggests that long-chain MKs may have higher absorption rates than phylloquinone from green vegetables [ 7 ].\nSeveral food sources of vitamin K are listed in Table 2. All values in this table are for phylloquinone content, except when otherwise indicated, because food composition data for menaquinones are limited [ 1 ].\n*DV = Daily Value. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for vitamin K is 120 mcg for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 17 ]. FDA does not require food labels to list vitamin K content unless vitamin K has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) FoodData Central [ 16 ] lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides comprehensive lists of foods containing vitamin K (phylloquinone) arranged by nutrient content and by food name and of foods containing vitamin K (MK-4) arranged by nutrient content and food name .\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "Vitamin K is present in most multivitamin/mineral supplements, typically at values less than 75% of the DV [ 18 ]. It is also available in dietary supplements containing only vitamin K or vitamin K combined with a few other nutrients, frequently calcium, magnesium, and/or vitamin D. These supplements tend to have a wider range of vitamin K doses than multivitamin/mineral supplements, with some providing 4,050 mcg (5,063% of the DV) or another very high amount [ 18 ].\nSeveral forms of vitamin K are used in dietary supplements, including vitamin K1 as phylloquinone or phytonadione (a synthetic form of vitamin K1) and vitamin K2 as MK-4 or MK-7 [ 18 ]. Few data are available on the relative bioavailability of the various forms of vitamin K supplements. One study found that both phytonadione and MK-7 supplements are well absorbed, but MK-7 has a longer half-life [ 19 ].\nMenadione, which is sometimes called vitamin K3, is another synthetic form of vitamin K. It was shown to damage hepatic cells in laboratory studies conducted during the 1980s and 1990s, so it is no longer used in dietary supplements or fortified foods [ 3 ].\n",

    "Coronary heart disease": "Vascular calcification is one of the risk factors for coronary heart disease because it reduces aortic and arterial elasticity [ 40 ]. MGP is a vitamin K-dependent protein that may play a role in the prevention of vascular calcification [ 5 , 41 ]. Although the full biological function of MGP is unclear, a hypothesis based on animal data suggests that inadequate vitamin K status leads to undercarboxylated MGP, which could increase vascular calcification and the risk of coronary heart disease. These findings might be particularly relevant for patients with chronic kidney disease because their rates of vascular calcification are much higher than those of the general population [ 9 ].\nIn an observational study conducted in the Netherlands in 564 postmenopausal women, dietary menaquinone (but not phylloquinone) intake was inversely associated with coronary calcification [ 42 ]. Menaquinone intake was also inversely associated with severe aortic calcification in a prospective, population-based cohort study involving 4,807 men and women age 55 years and older from the Netherlands [ 41 ]. Participants in this study who had dietary menaquinone intakes in the mid tertile (21.6–32.7 mcg/day) and upper tertile (>32.7 mcg/day) also had a 27% and 57% lower risk of coronary heart disease mortality, respectively, than those in the lower tertile of intake (<21.6 mcg/day). Phylloquinone intake had no effect on any outcome.\nDespite these data, few trials have investigated the effects of vitamin K supplementation on arterial calcification or coronary heart disease risk. One randomized, double-blind clinical trial examined the effect of phylloquinone supplementation in 388 healthy men and postmenopausal women age 60–80 years [ 43 ]. Participants received either a multivitamin (containing B-vitamins, vitamin C, and vitamin E) plus 500 International Units (IU) vitamin D3, 600 mg calcium, and 500 mcg phylloquinone daily (treatment) or a multivitamin plus calcium and vitamin D3 only (control) for 3 years. There was no significant difference in coronary artery calcification between the treatment and control groups. However, among the 295 participants who adhered to the supplementation protocol, those in the treatment group had significantly less coronary artery calcification progression than those in the control group. Furthermore, among those with coronary artery calcification at baseline, phylloquinone treatment reduced calcification progression by 6% compared to the control group. Based on these findings, the authors did not make any clinical recommendations, and they called for larger studies in other populations.\nAt this time, the role of the different forms of vitamin K on arterial calcification and the risk of coronary heart disease is unclear, but it continues to be an active area of research in the general population and in patients with chronic kidney disease [ 5 , 9 , 44 ].\n",

    "Vitamin K Intakes and Status": "Most U.S. diets contain an adequate amount of vitamin K [ 7 ]. Data from the 2011–2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) show that among children and teens age 2–19 years, the average daily vitamin K intake from foods is 66 mcg [ 20 ]. In adults age 20 and older, the average daily vitamin K intake from foods is 122 mcg for women and 138 mcg for men. When both foods and supplements are considered, the average daily vitamin K intake increases to 164 mcg for women and 182 mcg for men.\nSome analyses of NHANES datasets from 2003–2006 and 2007–2010 raised concerns about average vitamin K intakes because only about one-third of the U.S. population had a vitamin K intake above the AI [ 21 , 22 ]. The significance of these findings is unclear because the AI is only an estimate of need, especially for vitamins (like vitamin K) that are also synthesized endogenously. Moreover, reports of vitamin K deficiency in adults are very rare [ 3 , 7 ]. Finally, food composition databases provide information primarily on phylloquinone; menaquinones—either dietary or from bacterial production in the gut—likely also contribute to vitamin K status [ 1 , 6 , 7 ].\n",
    "Vitamin K Deficiency": "Vitamin K deficiency is only considered clinically relevant when prothrombin time increases significantly due to a decrease in the prothrombin activity of blood [ 3 , 7 ]. Thus, bleeding and hemorrhage are the classic signs of vitamin K deficiency, although these effects occur only in severe cases. Because vitamin K is required for the carboxylation of osteocalcin in bone, vitamin K deficiency could also reduce bone mineralization and contribute to osteoporosis [ 23 ].\nVitamin K deficiency can occur during the first few weeks of infancy due to low placental transfer of phylloquinone, low clotting factor levels, and low vitamin K content of breast milk [ 7 ]. Clinically significant vitamin K deficiency in adults is very rare and is usually limited to people with malabsorption disorders or those taking drugs that interfere with vitamin K metabolism [ 3 , 7 ]. In healthy people consuming a varied diet, achieving a vitamin K intake low enough to alter standard clinical measures of blood coagulation is almost impossible [ 3 ].\n",
    "Groups at Risk of Vitamin K Inadequacy": "The following groups are among those most likely to have inadequate vitamin K status.\n",
    "Newborns not treated with vitamin K at birth": "Vitamin K transport across the placenta is poor, increasing the risk of vitamin K deficiency in newborn babies [ 3 ]. During the first few weeks of life, vitamin K deficiency can cause vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB), a condition formerly known as classic hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. VKDB is associated with bleeding in the umbilicus, gastrointestinal tract, skin, nose, or other sites [ 7 , 24 , 25 ]. VKDB is known as early VKDB when it occurs in the first week of life. Late VKDB occurs at age 2–12 weeks, especially in exclusively breastfed infants due to the low vitamin K content of breast milk or in infants with malabsorption problems (such as cholestatic jaundice or cystic fibrosis) [ 7 ]. VKDB, especially late VKDB, can also be manifested as sudden intracranial bleeding, which has a high mortality rate [ 7 , 25 ]. To prevent VKDB, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the administration of a single, intramuscular dose of 0.5 to 1 milligram (mg) vitamin K1 at birth [ 24 ].\n",
    "People with malabsorption disorders": "People with malabsorption syndromes and other gastrointestinal disorders, such as cystic fibrosis, celiac disease, ulcerative colitis, and short bowel syndrome, might not absorb vitamin K properly [ 3 , 5 , 23 ]. Vitamin K status can also be low in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery, although clinical signs may not be present [ 26 ]. These individuals might need monitoring of vitamin K status and, in some cases, vitamin K supplementation.\n",
    "Vitamin K and Health": "This section focuses on two conditions in which vitamin K might play a role: osteoporosis and coronary heart disease.\n",
    "Osteoporosis": "Osteoporosis, a disorder characterized by porous and fragile bones, is a serious public health problem that affects more than 10 million U.S. adults, 80% of whom are women. Consuming adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D, especially throughout childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood, is important to maximize bone mass and reduce the risk of osteoporosis [ 27 ]. The effect of vitamin K intakes and status on bone health and osteoporosis has been a focus of scientific research.\nVitamin K is a cofactor for the gamma-carboxylation of many proteins, including osteocalcin, one of the main proteins in bone [ 28 ]. Some research indicates that high serum levels of undercarboxylated osteocalcin are associated with lower bone mineral density [ 5 , 28 ]. Some, but not all, studies also link higher vitamin K intakes with higher bone mineral density and/or lower hip fracture incidence [ 29-34 ].\nAlthough vitamin K is involved in the carboxylation of osteocalcin, it is unclear whether supplementation with any form of vitamin K reduces the risk of osteoporosis. In 2006, Cockayne and colleagues conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that examined the effects of vitamin K supplementation on bone mineral density and bone fracture [ 35 ]. Most of the trials were conducted in Japan and involved postmenopausal women; trial duration ranged from 6 to 36 months. Thirteen trials were included in the systematic review, and 12 showed that supplementation with either phytonadione or MK-4 improved bone mineral density. Seven of the 13 trials also had fracture data that were combined in a meta-analysis. All of these trials used MK-4 at either 15 mg/day (1 trial) or 45 mg/day (6 trials). MK-4 supplementation significantly reduced rates of hip fractures, vertebral fractures, and all nonvertebral fractures.\nA subsequent clinical trial found that MK-7 supplementation (180 mcg/day for 3 years) improved bone strength and decreased the loss in vertebral height in the lower thoracic region of the vertebrae in postmenopausal women [ 36 ]. Other randomized clinical trials since the 2006 review by Cockayne et al. have found that vitamin K supplementation has no effect on bone mineral density in elderly men or women [ 37 , 38 ]. In one of these studies, 381 postmenopausal women received either 1 mg phylloquinone, 45 mg MK-4, or placebo daily for 12 months [ 38 ]. All participants also received daily supplements containing 630 mg calcium and 400 IU vitamin D3. At the end of the study, participants receiving either phylloquinone or MK-4 had significantly lower levels of undercarboxylated osteocalcin compared to those receiving placebo. However, there were no significant differences in bone mineral density of the lumbar spine or proximal femur among any of the treatment groups. The authors noted the importance of considering the effect of vitamin D on bone health when comparing the results of vitamin K supplementation studies, especially if both vitamin K and vitamin D (and/or calcium) are administered to the treatment group but not the placebo group [ 38 ]. The administration of vitamin D and/or calcium along with vitamin K could partly explain why some studies have found that vitamin K supplementation improves bone health while others have not.\nIn Japan and other parts of Asia, a pharmacological dose of MK-4 (45 mg) is used as a treatment for osteoporosis [ 5 ]. The European Food Safety Authority has approved a health claim for vitamin K, noting that \"a cause and effect relationship has been established between the dietary intake of vitamin K and the maintenance of normal bone\" [ 39 ]. FDA has not authorized a health claim for vitamin K in the United States.\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Vitamin K": "The FNB did not establish ULs for vitamin K because of its low potential for toxicity [ 3 ]. In its report, the FNB stated that \"no adverse effects associated with vitamin K consumption from food or supplements have been reported in humans or animals.\"\n",
    "Warfarin (Coumadin) and similar anticoagulants": "Vitamin K can have a serious and potentially dangerous interaction with anticoagulants such as warfarin (Coumadin) as well as phenprocoumon, acenocoumarol, and tioclomarol, which are commonly used in some European countries [ 7 , 8 ]. These drugs antagonize the activity of vitamin K, leading to the depletion of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. People taking warfarin and similar anticoagulants need to maintain a consistent intake of vitamin K from food and supplements because sudden changes in vitamin K intakes can increase or decrease the anticoagulant effect [ 45 ].\n",
    "Antibiotics": "Antibiotics can destroy vitamin K-producing bacteria in the gut, potentially decreasing vitamin K status. This effect might be more pronounced with cephalosporin antibiotics, such as cefoperazone (Cefobid), because these antibiotics might also inhibit the action of vitamin K in the body [ 6 , 46 ]. Vitamin K supplements are usually not needed unless antibiotic use is prolonged (beyond several weeks) and accompanied by poor vitamin K intake [ 46 ].\n",
    "Bile acid sequestrants": "Bile acid sequestrants, such as cholestyramine (Questran) and colestipol (Colestid), are used to reduce cholesterol levels by preventing reabsorption of bile acids. They can also reduce the absorption of vitamin K and other fat-soluble vitamins, although the clinical significance of this effect is not clear [ 46 , 47 ]. Vitamin K status should be monitored in people taking these medications, especially when the drugs are used for many years [ 47 ].\n",
    "Vitamin K and Healthful Diets": "The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Many vegetables are excellent sources of vitamin K, and some fruits and fruit juices contain vitamin K. Cheese contains vitamin K. Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. ​​​​​​​Soybeans and nuts contain vitamin K.

    "Table of Contents": "Introduction Recommended Intakes Sources of Magnesium Magnesium Intakes and Status Magnesium Deficiency Groups at Risk of Magnesium Inadequacy Magnesium and Health Health Risks from Excessive Magnesium Interactions with Medications Magnesium and Healthful Diets References Disclaimer\nThis is a fact sheet intended for health professionals.  For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet .\n",
    "Introduction": "Magnesium, an abundant mineral in the body, is naturally present in many foods, added to other food products, available as a dietary supplement, and present in some medicines (such as antacids and laxatives). Magnesium is a cofactor in more than 300 enzyme systems that regulate diverse biochemical reactions in the body, including protein synthesis, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control, and blood pressure regulation [ 1-3 ]. Magnesium is required for energy production, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis. It contributes to the structural development of bone and is required for the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and the antioxidant glutathione. Magnesium also plays a role in the active transport of calcium and potassium ions across cell membranes, a process that is important to nerve impulse conduction, muscle contraction, and normal heart rhythm [ 3 ].\nAn adult body contains approximately 25 g magnesium, with 50% to 60% present in the bones and most of the rest in soft tissues [ 4 ]. Less than 1% of total magnesium is in blood serum, and these levels are kept under tight control. Normal serum magnesium concentrations range between 0.75 and 0.95 millimoles (mmol)/L [ 1 , 5 ]. Hypomagnesemia is defined as a serum magnesium level less than 0.75 mmol/L [ 6 ]. Magnesium homeostasis is largely controlled by the kidney, which typically excretes about 120 mg magnesium into the urine each day [ 2 ]. Urinary excretion is reduced when magnesium status is low [ 1 ].\nAssessing magnesium status is difficult because most magnesium is inside cells or in bone [ 3 ]. The most commonly used and readily available method for assessing magnesium status is measurement of serum magnesium concentration, even though serum levels have little correlation with total body magnesium levels or concentrations in specific tissues [ 6 ]. Other methods for assessing magnesium status include measuring magnesium concentrations in erythrocytes, saliva, and urine; measuring ionized magnesium concentrations in blood, plasma, or serum; and conducting a magnesium-loading (or tolerance) test. No single method is considered satisfactory [ 7 ]. Some experts [ 4 ] but not others [ 3 ] consider the tolerance test (in which urinary magnesium is measured after parenteral infusion of a dose of magnesium) to be the best method to assess magnesium status in adults. To comprehensively evaluate magnesium status, both laboratory tests and a clinical assessment might be required [ 6 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for magnesium and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies (formerly National Academy of Sciences) [ 1 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used to plan and assess nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nTable 1 lists the current RDAs for magnesium [ 1 ]. For infants from birth to 12 months, the FNB established an AI for magnesium that is equivalent to the mean intake of magnesium in healthy, breastfed infants, with added solid foods for ages 7–12 months.\n*Adequate Intake (AI)\n",
    "Food": "Magnesium is widely distributed in plant and animal foods and in beverages. Green leafy vegetables, such as spinach, legumes, nuts, seeds, and whole grains, are good sources [ 1 , 3 ]. In general, foods containing dietary fiber provide magnesium. Magnesium is also added to some breakfast cereals and other fortified foods. Some types of food processing, such as refining grains in ways that remove the nutrient-rich germ and bran, lower magnesium content substantially [ 1 ]. Selected food sources of magnesium are listed in Table 2.\nTap, mineral, and bottled waters can also be sources of magnesium, but the amount of magnesium in water varies by source and brand (ranging from 1 mg/L to more than 120 mg/L) [ 8 ].\nApproximately 30% to 40% of the dietary magnesium consumed is typically absorbed by the body [ 2 , 9 ].\n*DV = Daily Value. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for magnesium is 420 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 11 ]. FDA does not require food labels to list magnesium content unless magnesium has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) FoodData Central [ 10 ] lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides comprehensive list of foods containing magnesium arranged by nutrient content and by food name .\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "Magnesium supplements are available in a variety of forms, including magnesium oxide, citrate, and chloride [ 2 , 3 ]. The Supplement Facts panel on a dietary supplement label declares the amount of elemental magnesium in the product, not the weight of the entire magnesium-containing compound.\nAbsorption of magnesium from different kinds of magnesium supplements varies. Forms of magnesium that dissolve well in liquid are more completely absorbed in the gut than less soluble forms [ 2 , 12 ]. Small studies have found that magnesium in the aspartate, citrate, lactate, and chloride forms is absorbed more completely and is more bioavailable than magnesium oxide and magnesium sulfate [ 12-16 ]. One study found that very high doses of zinc from supplements (142 mg/day) can interfere with magnesium absorption and disrupt the magnesium balance in the body [ 17 ].\n",

    "Type 2 diabetes": "Diets with higher amounts of magnesium are associated with a significantly lower risk of diabetes, possibly because of the important role of magnesium in glucose metabolism [ 41 , 42 ]. Hypomagnesemia might worsen insulin resistance, a condition that often precedes diabetes, or it might be a consequence of insulin resistance [ 43 ]. Diabetes leads to increased urinary losses of magnesium, and the subsequent magnesium inadequacy might impair insulin secretion and action, thereby worsening diabetes control [ 3 ].\nMost investigations of magnesium intake and risk of type 2 diabetes have been prospective cohort studies. A meta-analysis of seven of these studies, which included 286,668 patients and 10,912 cases of diabetes over 6 to 17 years of follow-up, found that a 100 mg/day increase in total magnesium intake decreased the risk of diabetes by a statistically significant 15% [ 41 ]. Another meta-analysis of eight prospective cohort studies that followed 271,869 men and women over 4 to 18 years found a significant inverse association between magnesium intake from food and risk of type 2 diabetes; the relative risk reduction was 23% when the highest to lowest intakes were compared [ 44 ].\nA 2011 meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies of the association between magnesium intake and risk of type 2 diabetes included 13 studies with a total of 536,318 participants and 24,516 cases of diabetes [ 45 ]. The mean length of follow-up ranged from 4 to 20 years. Investigators found an inverse association between magnesium intake and risk of type 2 diabetes in a dose-responsive fashion, but this association achieved statistical significance only in individuals who were overweight (body mass index [BMI] 25 or higher) but not in normal-weight individuals (BMI less than 25). Again, a limitation of these observational studies is the possibility of confounding with other dietary components or lifestyle or environmental variables that are correlated with magnesium intake.\nOnly a few small, short-term clinical trials have examined the potential effects of supplemental magnesium on control of type 2 diabetes and the results are conflicting [ 42 , 46 ]. For example, 128 patients with poorly controlled diabetes in a Brazilian clinical trial received a placebo or a supplement containing either 500 mg/day or 1,000 mg/day magnesium oxide (providing 300 or 600 mg elemental magnesium, respectively) [ 47 ]. After 30 days of supplementation, plasma, cellular, and urine magnesium levels increased in participants receiving the larger dose of the supplement, and their glycemic control improved. In another small trial in Mexico, participants with type 2 diabetes and hypomagnesemia who received a liquid supplement of magnesium chloride (providing 300 mg/day elemental magnesium) for 16 weeks showed significant reductions in fasting glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin concentrations compared with participants receiving a placebo, and their serum magnesium levels became normal [ 48 ]. In contrast, neither a supplement of magnesium aspartate (providing 369 mg/day elemental magnesium) nor a placebo taken for 3 months had any effect on glycemic control in 50 patients with type 2 diabetes who were taking insulin [ 49 ].\nThe American Diabetes Association states that there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of magnesium to improve glycemic control in people with diabetes [ 46 ]. It further notes that there is no clear scientific evidence that vitamin and mineral supplementation benefits people with diabetes who do not have underlying nutritional deficiencies.\n",

    "Osteoporosis": "Magnesium is involved in bone formation and influences the activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts [ 50 ]. Magnesium also affects the concentrations of both parathyroid hormone and the active form of vitamin D, which are major regulators of bone homeostasis. Several population-based studies have found positive associations between magnesium intake and bone mineral density in both men and women [ 51 ]. Other research has found that women with osteoporosis have lower serum magnesium levels than women with osteopenia and those who do not have osteoporosis or osteopenia [ 52 ]. These and other findings indicate that magnesium deficiency might be a risk factor for osteoporosis [ 50 ].\nAlthough limited in number, studies suggest that increasing magnesium intakes from food or supplements might increase bone mineral density in postmenopausal and elderly women [ 1 ]. For example, one short-term study found that 290 mg/day elemental magnesium (as magnesium citrate) for 30 days in 20 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis suppressed bone turnover compared with placebo, suggesting that bone loss decreased [ 53 ].\nDiets that provide recommended levels of magnesium enhance bone health, but further research is needed to elucidate the role of magnesium in the prevention and management of osteoporosis.\n",

These antibiotics should be taken at least 2 hours before or 4–6 hours after a magnesium-containing supplement [ 57 , 62 ].\n",

    "Magnesium Intakes and Status": "Dietary surveys of people in the United States consistently show that many people consume less than recommended amounts of magnesium. An analysis of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) of 2013–2016 found that 48% of Americans of all ages ingest less magnesium from food and beverages than their respective EARs; adult men age 71 years and older and adolescent males and females are most likely to have low intakes [ 22 ]. In a study using data from NHANES 2003–2006 to assess mineral intakes among adults, average intakes of magnesium from food alone were higher among users of dietary supplements (350 mg for men and 267 mg for women, equal to or slightly exceeding their respective EARs) than among nonusers (268 mg for men and 234 for women) [ 23 ]. When supplements were included, average total intakes of magnesium were 449 mg for men and 387 mg for women, well above EAR levels.\nNo current data on magnesium status in the United States are available. Determining dietary intake of magnesium is the usual proxy for assessing magnesium status. NHANES has not determined serum magnesium levels in its participants since 1974 [ 24 ], and magnesium is not evaluated in routine electrolyte testing in hospitals and clinics [ 2 ].\n",
    "Magnesium Deficiency": "Symptomatic magnesium deficiency due to low dietary intake in otherwise-healthy people is uncommon because the kidneys limit urinary excretion of this mineral [ 3 ]. However, habitually low intakes or excessive losses of magnesium due to certain health conditions, chronic alcoholism, and/or the use of certain medications can lead to magnesium deficiency.\nEarly signs of magnesium deficiency include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and weakness. As magnesium deficiency worsens, numbness, tingling, muscle contractions and cramps, seizures, personality changes, abnormal heart rhythms, and coronary spasms can occur [ 1 , 2 ]. Severe magnesium deficiency can result in hypocalcemia or hypokalemia (low serum calcium or potassium levels, respectively) because mineral homeostasis is disrupted [ 2 ].\n",
    "Groups at Risk of Magnesium Inadequacy": "Magnesium inadequacy can occur when intakes fall below the RDA but are above the amount required to prevent overt deficiency. The following groups are more likely than others to be at risk of magnesium inadequacy because they typically consume insufficient amounts or they have medical conditions (or take medications) that reduce magnesium absorption from the gut or increase losses from the body.\n",
    "People with gastrointestinal diseases": "The chronic diarrhea and fat malabsorption resulting from Crohn's disease, gluten-sensitive enteropathy (celiac disease), and regional enteritis can lead to magnesium depletion over time [ 2 ]. Resection or bypass of the small intestine, especially the ileum, typically leads to malabsorption and magnesium loss [ 2 ].\n",
    "People with type 2 diabetes": "Magnesium deficits and increased urinary magnesium excretion can occur in people with insulin resistance and/or type 2 diabetes [ 25 , 26 ]. The magnesium loss appears to be secondary to higher concentrations of glucose in the kidney that increase urine output [ 2 ].\n",
    "Magnesium and Health": "Habitually low intakes of magnesium induce changes in biochemical pathways that can increase the risk of illness over time. This section focuses on four diseases and disorders in which magnesium might be involved: hypertension and cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, and migraine headaches.\n",
    "Hypertension and cardiovascular disease": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke. Studies to date, however, have found that magnesium supplementation lowers blood pressure, at best, to only a small extent. A meta-analysis of 12 clinical trials found that magnesium supplementation for 8–26 weeks in 545 hypertensive participants resulted in only a small reduction (2.2 mmHg) in diastolic blood pressure [ 31 ]. The dose of magnesium ranged from approximately 243 to 973 mg/day. The authors of another meta-analysis of 22 studies with 1,173 normotensive and hypertensive adults concluded that magnesium supplementation for 3–24 weeks decreased systolic blood pressure by 3–4 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 2–3 mmHg [ 32 ]. The effects were somewhat larger when supplemental magnesium intakes of the participants in the nine crossover-design trials exceeded 370 mg/day. A diet containing more magnesium because of added fruits and vegetables, more low-fat or nonfat dairy products, and less fat overall was shown to lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure by an average of 5.5 and 3.0 mmHg, respectively [ 33 ]. However, this Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet also increases intakes of other nutrients, such as potassium and calcium, that are associated with reductions in blood pressure, so any independent contribution of magnesium cannot be determined.\nIn 2022, FDA approved a qualified health claim for conventional foods and dietary supplements that contain magnesium [ 34 ]. One example of this claim states, “Consuming diets with adequate magnesium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure (hypertension). However, FDA has concluded that the evidence is inconsistent and inconclusive.” FDA also specifies that foods and dietary supplements carrying this claim on their labels must provide at least 84 mg of magnesium per serving and, for dietary supplements, no more than 350 mg.\nSeveral prospective studies have examined associations between magnesium intakes and heart disease. The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study assessed heart disease risk factors and levels of serum magnesium in a cohort of 14,232 White and African-American men and women age 45 to 64 years at baseline [ 35 ]. Over an average of 12 years of follow-up, individuals in the highest quartile of the normal physiologic range of serum magnesium (at least 0.88 mmol/L) had a 38% reduced risk of sudden cardiac death compared with individuals in the lowest quartile (0.75 mmol/L or less). However, dietary magnesium intakes had no association with risk of sudden cardiac death. Another prospective study tracked 88,375 female nurses in the United States to determine whether serum magnesium levels measured early in the study and magnesium intakes from food and supplements assessed every 2 to 4 years were associated with sudden cardiac death over 26 years of follow-up [ 36 ]. Women in the highest compared with the lowest quartile of ingested and plasma magnesium concentrations had a 34% and 77% lower risk of sudden cardiac death, respectively. Another prospective population study of 7,664 adults age 20 to 75 years in the Netherlands who did not have cardiovascular disease found that low urinary magnesium excretion levels (a marker for low dietary magnesium intake) were associated with a higher risk of ischemic heart disease over a median follow-up period of 10.5 years. Plasma magnesium concentrations were not associated with risk of ischemic heart disease [ 37 ]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies found that higher serum levels of magnesium were significantly associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, and higher dietary magnesium intakes (up to approximately 250 mg/day) were associated with a significantly lower risk of ischemic heart disease caused by a reduced blood supply to the heart muscle [ 38 ].\nHigher magnesium intakes might reduce the risk of stroke. In a meta-analysis of seven prospective trials with a total of 241,378 participants, an additional 100 mg/day magnesium in the diet was associated with an 8% decreased risk of total stroke, especially ischemic rather than hemorrhagic stroke [ 39 ]. One limitation of such observational studies, however, is the possibility of confounding with other nutrients or dietary components that could also affect the risk of stroke.\nA large, well-designed clinical trial is needed to better understand the contributions of magnesium from food and dietary supplements to heart health and the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [ 40 ].\n",
    "Migraine headaches": "Magnesium deficiency is related to factors that promote headaches, including neurotransmitter release and vasoconstriction [ 54 ]. People who experience migraine headaches have lower levels of serum and tissue magnesium than those who do not.\nHowever, research on the use of magnesium supplements to prevent or reduce symptoms of migraine headaches is limited. Three of four small, short-term, placebo-controlled trials found modest reductions in the frequency of migraines in patients given up to 600 mg/day magnesium [ 54 ]. The authors of a review on migraine prophylaxis suggested that taking 300 mg magnesium twice a day, either alone or in combination with medication, can prevent migraines [ 55 ].\nIn their evidence-based guideline update, the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society concluded that magnesium therapy is probably effective for migraine prevention [ 56 ]. Because the typical dose of magnesium used for migraine prevention exceeds the UL, this treatment should be used only under the direction and supervision of a health care provider.\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Magnesium": "Too much magnesium from food does not pose a health risk in healthy individuals because the kidneys eliminate excess amounts in the urine [ 29 ]. However, high doses of magnesium from dietary supplements or medications often result in diarrhea that can be accompanied by nausea and abdominal cramping [ 1 ]. Forms of magnesium most commonly reported to cause diarrhea include magnesium carbonate, chloride, gluconate, and oxide [ 12 ]. The diarrhea and laxative effects of magnesium salts are due to the osmotic activity of unabsorbed salts in the intestine and colon and the stimulation of gastric motility [ 57 ].\nVery large doses of magnesium-containing laxatives and antacids (typically providing more than 5,000 mg/day magnesium) have been associated with magnesium toxicity [ 58 ], including fatal hypermagnesemia in a 28-month-old boy [ 59 ] and an elderly man [ 60 ]. Symptoms of magnesium toxicity, which usually develop after serum concentrations exceed 1.74–2.61 mmol/L, can include hypotension, nausea, vomiting, facial flushing, retention of urine, ileus, depression, and lethargy before progressing to muscle weakness, difficulty breathing, extreme hypotension, irregular heartbeat, and cardiac arrest [ 29 ]. The risk of magnesium toxicity increases with impaired renal function or kidney failure because the ability to remove excess magnesium is reduced or lost [ 1 , 29 ].\nThe FNB has established ULs for supplemental magnesium for healthy infants, children, and adults (see Table 3) [ 1 ]. For many age groups, the UL appears to be lower than the RDA. This occurs because the RDAs include magnesium from all sources—food, beverages, dietary supplements, and medications. The ULs include magnesium from only dietary supplements and medications; they do not include magnesium found naturally in food and beverages.\n",
    "Bisphosphonates": "Magnesium-rich supplements or medications can decrease the absorption of oral bisphosphonates, such as alendronate (Fosamax), used to treat osteoporosis [ 61 ]. Use of magnesium-rich supplements or medications and oral bisphosphonates should be separated by at least 2 hours [ 57 ].\n",
    "Diuretics": "Chronic treatment with loop diuretics, such as furosemide (Lasix) and bumetanide (Bumex), and thiazide diuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide (Aquazide H) and ethacrynic acid (Edecrin), can increase the loss of magnesium in urine and lead to magnesium depletion [ 63 ]. In contrast, potassium-sparing diuretics, such as amiloride (Midamor) and spironolactone (Aldactone), reduce magnesium excretion [ 63 ].\n",
    "Magnesium and Healthful Diets": "The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Whole grains and dark-green, leafy vegetables are good sources of magnesium. Low-fat milk and yogurt contain magnesium as well. Some ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are fortified with magnesium. Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. ​​​​​​​Dried beans and legumes (such as soybeans, baked beans, lentils, and peanuts) and nuts (such as almonds and cashews) provide magnesium. Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Limits alcoholic beverages. Stays within your daily calorie needs.\nWhole grains and dark-green, leafy vegetables are good sources of magnesium. Low-fat milk and yogurt contain magnesium as well.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet .\n",
    "Introduction": "Manganese is an essential trace element that is naturally present in many foods and available as a dietary supplement. Manganese is a cofactor for many enzymes, including manganese superoxide dismutase, arginase, and pyruvate carboxylase [ 1 , 2 ]. Through the action of these enzymes, manganese is involved in amino acid, cholesterol, glucose, and carbohydrate metabolism; reactive oxygen species scavenging; bone formation; reproduction; and immune response [ 3-7 ]. Manganese also plays a role in blood clotting and hemostasis in conjunction with vitamin K [ 5 ].\nManganese is absorbed in the small intestine through an active transport system and, possibly, through diffusion when intakes are high [ 2 ]. After absorption, some manganese remains free, but most is bound to transferrin, albumin, and plasma alpha-2-macroglobulin. Manganese is taken up by the liver and other tissues, but the mechanism of this process is not well understood [ 1 , 2 ].\nThe human body contains about 10 to 20 mg manganese, of which 25% to 40% is in bone [ 1 , 2 ]. The liver, pancreas, kidney, and brain also contain manganese. The body maintains stable tissue manganese concentrations through regulatory control of manganese absorption and excretion [ 5 ]. More than 90% of absorbed manganese is excreted via bile into the feces, and a small amount is reabsorbed [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 ]. Very little is excreted in urine.\nManganese status is difficult to assess and not routinely measured in clinical practice. Normal whole blood concentrations of manganese range from 4 to 15 mcg/L [ 1 ], but they are highly variable and their utility as a status indicator is unclear [ 4 ]. Some studies that measured serum or plasma manganese concentrations in apparently healthy adults have shown mean serum concentrations of 1.04 mcg/L and mean plasma concentrations of 1.28 mcg/L [ 4 , 8 ]. Large variations in manganese intakes appear to affect these concentrations somewhat [ 9 ]. However, these concentrations often do not correlate well with typical manganese intakes, so whether they are useful indicators of manganese status is not clear [ 4 ].\nAlthough urinary manganese concentrations decrease with severe deficiency, it is not clear whether they are useful indicators of manganese status when intakes are within the normal range [ 4 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for manganese and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by an expert committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [ 4 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nIn its 2001 evaluation, the FNB found the existing data insufficient to derive an EAR for manganese. The FNB therefore established AIs for all ages based on usual manganese intakes in healthy populations [ 4 ]. Table 1 lists the current AIs for manganese.\n*For infants from birth to age 6 months, the AI is based on mean manganese intakes of infants fed primarily human milk.\n",
    "Food": "Manganese is present in a wide variety of foods, including whole grains, clams, oysters, mussels, nuts, soybeans and other legumes, rice, leafy vegetables, coffee, tea, and many spices such as black pepper [ 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 11 ]. Drinking water also contains small amounts of manganese at concentrations of 1 to 100 mcg/L [ 5 ]. The top sources of manganese in the diets of U.S. adults are grain products, tea, and vegetables [ 4 ].\nManganese concentrations are 3 to 10 mcg/L in breast milk and 30 to 100 mcg/L in cow’s milk–based infant formulas [ 5 , 12 ]. Soy-based infant formulas have higher manganese concentrations, 200 to 300 mcg/L, than milk-based formulas [ 12 ]. Limited research suggests that the absorption rate of manganese from human milk (8.2%) is much higher than that from soy formula (0.7%) and cow’s milk formula (3.1%) [ 13 ].\nHumans absorb only about 1% to 5% of dietary manganese [ 2 , 5 , 7 ]. Infants and children tend to absorb greater amounts of manganese than adults [ 7 ]. In addition, manganese absorption efficiency increases with low manganese intakes and decreases with higher intakes [ 1 , 2 ], but little is known about the mechanisms that control absorption [ 1 ].\nDietary iron intakes and iron status (measured by serum ferritin concentration) appear to be inversely associated with manganese absorption [ 14 , 15 ]. The mechanism for this effect is unknown, but the shared transporter of iron and manganese in the intestine might play a role [ 2 ]. In addition, men appear to absorb dietary manganese less efficiently than women, possibly because men usually have higher iron status [ 7 , 16 ]. Infants absorb higher proportions of manganese than adults; limited research shows that formula-fed infants retain about 20% of the manganese they consume [ 5 ].\nSelected food sources of manganese are listed in Table 2.\n*DV = Daily Value. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for manganese is 2.3 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 17 ]. FDA does not require food labels to list manganese content unless manganese has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA's) FoodData Central website [ 11 ] lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing manganese ordered by nutrient content .\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "In dietary supplements, manganese is present in many different forms, including amino acid chelates (e.g., manganese bisglycinate chelate, manganese glycinate chelate, and manganese aspartate) [ 18 ]. Other forms include manganese gluconate, manganese picolinate, manganese sulfate, manganese citrate, and manganese chloride. No data are available on the relative bioavailability of different forms of supplemental manganese. The Supplement Facts label on a dietary supplement product declares the amount of elemental manganese in the product, not the weight of the entire manganese-containing compound.\nNot all multivitamin/mineral supplements contain manganese, but those that do typically provide 1.0 to 4.5 mg manganese [ 18 ]. Supplements containing only manganese, or manganese with a few other nutrients, are also available, and most contain 5 to 20 mg manganese. Many dietary supplements that contain manganese are listed in the Dietary Supplement Label Database from the National Institutes of Health [ 18 ]. This database contains label information from tens of thousands of dietary supplement products on the market.\n",

    "Bone health": "Manganese is a cofactor for several enzymes involved in bone formation [ 6 ]. In animals, manganese deficiency can impair bone formation and reduce bone mineral density [ 23 ], and manganese supplementation can increase both bone mineral density and bone formation [ 24 ].\nScientists have examined whether associations exist between circulating manganese levels, bone mineral density, and osteoporosis in humans, but the evidence is very limited and inconsistent. In one study, 10 women with osteoporosis (mean age, 69.3 years) had lower serum manganese levels (20 mcg/L) than 20 women (mean age, 64.5 years) who did not have osteoporosis (40 mcg/L) [ 25 ]. In another study in 40 postmenopausal women, serum manganese levels were positively associated with bone mineral density and negatively associated with bone fracture rates [ 26 ]. Conversely, a study in 77 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (median age 61 years) and 61 postmenopausal women without osteoporosis (median age 60 years) found no differences in red blood cell manganese levels (14.76 mcg/L for women with osteoporosis vs. 15.54 mcg/L for women without osteoporosis) or plasma manganese levels (5.34 mcg/L for women with osteoporosis vs. 5.09 mcg/L for women without osteoporosis) [ 27 ]. In addition, no associations between plasma manganese levels and bone mineral density were observed in a study of 90 men age 50 to 80 years [ 28 ].\nNo clinical trials have evaluated the effects of manganese supplementation alone on bone health. In one small clinical trial, supplementation with calcium (1,000 mg) plus trace minerals (5 mg manganese, 15 mg zinc, and 2.5 mg copper) for 2 years improved spinal bone density compared with placebo in 59 healthy postmenopausal women (mean age 66 years) [ 29 ]. However, it is not possible to determine to what extent, if any, the manganese alone affected bone density.\nMore research is needed to determine whether manganese supplementation affects bone health in humans.\n",

    "Manganese Intakes and Status": "Data on manganese intakes are very limited, but they suggest that most people obtain adequate amounts of manganese. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which provides dietary intake data for most nutrients, does not include manganese [ 19 ].\nThe Total Diet Study (TDS) is an FDA program that monitors the nutrient content of typical foods consumed by the U.S population [ 20 ]. The most recent report that used TDS data to estimate dietary manganese intakes, published in 1991, used TDS data from 1982 to 1989 [ 21 ]. According to this publication, dietary manganese intakes were 1.1 mg/day for infants age 6 to 11 months, 1.48 mg/day for children age 2 years, 1.78 to 2.76 mg/day for boys and girls age 14 to 16 years, 2.14 to 2.23 mg/day for women, and 2.64 to 2.81 mg/day for men [ 21 ]. These values met or exceeded the manganese AI for all age groups. More recent data from a population study of 719 adults age 18 to 87 years in northern Italy show a median dietary manganese intake of 2.34 mg/day [ 22 ].\nData on manganese intakes from dietary supplements are not currently available.\n",
    "Manganese Deficiency": "Manganese deficiency is very rare in humans, and signs and symptoms of deficiency have not been firmly established [ 1 , 2 ]. The very limited evidence in humans suggests that manganese deficiency might cause bone demineralization and poor growth in children; skin rashes, hair depigmentation, decreased serum cholesterol, and increased alkaline phosphatase activity in men; and altered mood and increased premenstrual pain in women [ 2 , 4 ]. Manganese deficiency might also alter lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and cause abnormal glucose tolerance [ 3 ].\n",
    "Groups at Risk of Manganese Inadequacy": "No known groups of people are likely to have inadequate manganese intakes.\n",
    "Manganese and Health": "Because of the role of manganese as a cofactor for several enzymes, low intakes might increase the risk of illness. This section focuses on two health areas in which manganese might be involved: bone health and diabetes.\n",
    "Diabetes": "As a cofactor for several enzymes, manganese is involved in glucose, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism, and manganese deficiency might affect carbohydrate metabolism and cause abnormalities in glucose tolerance [ 3 ]. Therefore, scientists have examined whether manganese status affects the risk of diabetes.\nSeveral studies have found associations between both increased [ 30 , 31 ] and decreased [ 32-34 ] blood levels of manganese and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes [ 35 ]. For example, in a case-control study in China of 122 adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and 429 adults without diabetes (age range for all participants was 40–92 years), those in the highest tertile of plasma manganese (>2.42 mcg/L) were 7.88 times more likely to have diabetes than those in the lowest tertile (<1.67 mcg/L) [ 30 ]. Conversely, in a case-control study in Sardinia of 192 adults with type 1 diabetes (mean age 48.8 years), 68 adults with type 2 diabetes (mean age 68.4 years), and 59 adults without diabetes (mean age 57.2 years), median blood concentrations of manganese were lower in those with either type 1 (8.62 mcg/L) or type 2 diabetes (10.7 mcg/L) than in those who did not have diabetes (14.2 mcg/L) [ 33 ].\nA large case-control study in China suggested a U-shaped association between plasma manganese levels and type 2 diabetes [ 35 ]. This study included 1,614 adults with type 2 diabetes (mean age 52.5 years) and 1,614 adults without diabetes (mean age 54.7 years). Compared with the middle tertile of plasma manganese concentration (4.21–6.84 mcg/L), those in the lowest tertile (≤4.21 mcg/L) were 1.89 times more likely, and those in the highest tertile (≥6.84 mcg/L) were 1.56 times more likely, to have type 2 diabetes. Other studies have found no associations between blood manganese levels and diabetes prevalence [ 36 , 37 ].\nResearch in animals suggests that manganese supplementation might improve glucose tolerance, reduce oxidative stress, and improve endothelial dysfunction in diabetes [ 3 ], but clinical trials in humans are lacking. More research is needed to determine whether manganese plays any role in the development of diabetes.\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Manganese": "No evidence shows manganese toxicity from high dietary manganese intakes [ 38 ]. However, manganese toxicity has occurred in people working in such occupations as welding and mining who were exposed to high amounts of manganese from chronic inhalation of manganese dust [ 1 , 39 ]. People who consume water containing high levels of manganese (in some cases as high as 28 mg/L) have also developed manganese toxicity [ 4 , 40 ].\nManganese toxicity mainly affects the central nervous system and can cause tremors, muscle spasms, tinnitus, hearing loss, and the feeling of being unsteady on one’s feet [ 1 , 2 ]. Additional symptoms include mania, insomnia, depression, delusions, anorexia, headaches, irritability, lower extremity weakness, changes in mood and short-term memory, altered reaction times, and reduced hand-eye coordination [ 1 , 39 ]. These signs and symptoms can progress to neuromotor impairments similar to those associated with Parkinson’s disease, including changes in gait and balance, tremor, and rigidity [ 1 , 4 ].\nIron deficiency increases manganese absorption and can therefore exacerbate symptoms of manganese toxicity [ 2 ]. People with chronic liver disease have impaired manganese elimination in bile and are more susceptible to manganese neurotoxicity and other adverse effects of excess manganese intakes [ 4 ].\nThe FNB established manganese ULs for healthy individuals based on levels associated with whole-blood manganese concentrations above the normal range of 4 to 15 mcg/L and risk of neurotoxicity [ 4 ]. The ULs do not apply to individuals who are taking supplemental manganese under medical supervision.\n*Breast milk, formula, and food should be the only sources of manganese for infants.\n",
    "Manganese and Healthful Diets": "The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Whole grains are rich sources of manganese. Some vegetables and fruits also contain manganese. Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. Nuts, legumes, and mollusks contain manganese. Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Limits alcoholic beverages. Stays within your daily calorie needs.\nWhole grains are rich sources of manganese.

    "Introduction": "Molybdenum is an essential trace element that is naturally present in many foods and is also available as a dietary supplement. Molybdenum is a structural constituent of molybdopterin, a cofactor synthesized by the body and required for the function of four enzymes: sulfite oxidase, xanthine oxidase, aldehyde oxidase, and mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component (mARC). These enzymes metabolize sulfur-containing amino acids and heterocyclic compounds including purines and pyrimidines [ 1 , 2 ]. Xanthine oxidase, aldehyde oxidase, and mARC are also involved in metabolizing drugs and toxins [ 3-6 ].\nMolybdenum appears to be absorbed via a passive nonmediated process, though where absorption occurs in the intestinal tract is not known [ 1 ]. Adults absorb 40% to 100% of dietary molybdenum [ 2 , 7-10 ]. Infants absorb almost all of the molybdenum in breast milk or formula [ 11 , 12 ].\nThe kidneys are the main regulators of molybdenum levels in the body and are responsible for its excretion [ 1 , 2 ]. Molybdenum, in the form of molybdopterin, is stored in the liver, kidney, adrenal glands, and bone [ 2 , 7 , 13 ].\nBecause molybdenum deficiency is rare [ 14 ], molybdenum status is not assessed in clinical settings. According to a small study of 30 healthy men and women, serum levels of molybdenum range from 0.28 ng/mL to 1.17 ng/mL, and their average is 0.58 ng/mL [ 15 ]. In another small study of four healthy young men, plasma levels of molybdenum reached 6.22 ng/mL with a molybdenum intake of 1,490 mcg per day for 24 days [ 10 ]. The average concentration of urinary molybdenum is 69 ng/mL, but urinary molybdenum does not reflect molybdenum status [ 1 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for molybdenum and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [ 1 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nThe basis for the EAR for molybdenum consists of two carefully controlled balance studies in a total of eight young men. The EAR for children and adolescents is extrapolated from adult values. Table 1 lists the current RDAs for molybdenum [ 1 ].\n",
    "Food": "Legumes are the richest sources of molybdenum [ 16 ]. Other foods high in molybdenum include whole grains, nuts, and beef liver [ 1 , 14 , 17 , 18 ].\nThe top sources of molybdenum in U.S. diets are legumes, cereal grains, leafy vegetables, beef liver, and milk [ 17 ]. Milk and cheese products are the main sources of molybdenum for teens and children [ 19 ].\nThe amount of molybdenum in food depends on the amount of molybdenum in the soil and in the water used for irrigation [ 1 , 2 ]. Drinking water generally contains only small amounts of molybdenum [ 17 ]. However, according to 2017 data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 0.8% of drinking water samples had molybdenum levels above 40 mcg/L [ 20 ]. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) FoodData Central [ 21 ] does not list the molybdenum content of foods or provide lists of foods containing molybdenum. Therefore, the amount of information on molybdenum levels in foods is quite limited.\n*DV = Daily Value. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for molybdenum is 45 mcg for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 22 ]. FDA does not require food labels to list molybdenum content unless molybdenum has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet.\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "Molybdenum is available in dietary supplements containing molybdenum only, in combination with other minerals, and in multivitamin/mineral products. Amounts range from about 50 mcg to 500 mcg. Forms of molybdenum in dietary supplements include molybdenum chloride, sodium molybdate, molybdenum glycinate, and molybdenum amino acid chelate [ 23 ]. No studies have compared the relative bioavailability of molybdenum from these different forms.\n",

    "Molybdenum Intakes and Status": "Most Americans appear to consume adequate amounts of molybdenum. Although national surveys no longer collect data about molybdenum intake, FDA’s 1984 Total Diet Study estimated that average daily molybdenum intakes from foods were 109 mcg in men and 76 mcg in women [ 24 ]. According to the 1988–1994 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, molybdenum intakes from dietary supplements averaged 23 mcg/day for men and 24 mcg/day for women [ 25 ]. Intakes of molybdenum from drinking water collected from the 100 largest cities in the United States are estimated to be about 3 mcg/day based on intakes of 2 liters of water per day [ 26 ].\n",
    "Molybdenum Deficiency": "Molybdenum deficiency has not been reported, except in people with a genetic mutation that prevents the synthesis of molybdopterin and therefore of sulfite oxidase [ 14 ]. In this rare metabolic disorder, known as molybdenum cofactor deficiency, mutations in one of several genes prevent the biosynthesis of molybdopterin. The absence of molybdopterin impairs the function of enzymes that metabolize sulfite, leading to encephalopathy and seizures [ 1 , 14 , 27-29 ]; the neurological damage is severe and usually leads to death within days after birth [ 18 , 30 ].\nA single reported incident of acquired molybdenum deficiency occurred in 1981 in a patient receiving total parenteral nutrition that was devoid of molybdenum. The patient developed tachycardia, tachypnea, headache, night blindness, and coma. These effects resolved with molybdenum administration [ 1 , 31 ].\n",
    "Groups at Risk of Molybdenum Inadequacy": "No known groups of people are likely to have inadequate molybdenum intakes.\n",
    "Molybdenum and Health": "Molybdenum is not a standard treatment for any disease or disorder.\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Molybdenum": "Acute molybdenum toxicity is rare, but it can occur with industrial mining and metalworking exposure. In healthy people, consumption of a diet high in molybdenum usually does not pose a health risk because the molybdenum is rapidly excreted in urine [ 1 , 14 , 18 ]. One study assessed the effect of high dietary intakes of molybdenum (10–15 mg/day) in an area of Armenia where the soil contains very high levels of molybdenum. The affected individuals experienced achy joints, gout-like symptoms, and abnormally high blood levels of uric acid [ 14 ].\nGiven the absence of human studies, the FNB established ULs for molybdenum for healthy individuals based on levels associated with impaired reproduction and fetal development in rats and mice [ 1 ].\n* Breast milk, formula, and food should be the only sources of molybdenum for infants.\n",
    "Molybdenum and Healthful Diets": "The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Whole grains contain molybdenum. Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. ​​​​​​​Legumes and nuts contain molybdenum. Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Limits alcoholic beverages.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet .\n",
    "Introduction": "Niacin (also known as vitamin B3) is one of the water-soluble B vitamins. Niacin is the generic name for nicotinic acid (pyridine-3-carboxylic acid), nicotinamide (niacinamide or pyridine-3-carboxamide), and related derivatives, such as nicotinamide riboside [ 1-3 ]. Niacin is naturally present in many foods, added to some food products, and available as a dietary supplement.\nAll tissues in the body convert absorbed niacin into its main metabolically active form, the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). More than 400 enzymes require NAD to catalyze reactions in the body, which is more than for any other vitamin-derived coenzyme [ 1 ]. NAD is also converted into another active form, the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), in all tissues except skeletal muscle [ 4 ].\nNAD and NADP are required in most metabolic redox processes in cells where substrates are oxidized or reduced. NAD is primarily involved in catabolic reactions that transfer the potential energy in carbohydrates, fats, and proteins to adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's primary energy currency [ 4 ]. NAD is also required for enzymes involved in critical cellular functions, such as the maintenance of genome integrity, control of gene expression, and cellular communication [ 3 , 4 ]. NADP, in contrast, enables anabolic reactions, such as the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids, and plays a critical role in maintaining cellular antioxidant function.\nMost dietary niacin is in the form of nicotinic acid and nicotinamide, but some foods contain small amounts of NAD and NADP. The body also converts some tryptophan, an amino acid in protein, to NAD, so tryptophan is considered a dietary source of niacin.\nWhen NAD and NADP are consumed in foods, they are converted to nicotinamide in the gut and then absorbed [ 4 ]. Ingested niacin is absorbed primarily in the small intestine, but some is absorbed in the stomach [ 1-3 ].\nEven when taken in very high doses of 3–4 g, niacin is almost completely absorbed. Once absorbed, physiologic amounts of niacin are metabolized to NAD. Some excess niacin is taken up by red blood cells to form a circulating reserve pool. The liver methylates any remaining excess to N1-methyl-nicotinamide, N1-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide, and other pyridone oxidation products, which are then excreted in the urine. Unmetabolized nicotinic acid and nicotinamide might be present in the urine as well when niacin intakes are very high.\nLevels of niacin in the blood are not reliable indicators of niacin status. The most sensitive and reliable measure of niacin status is the urinary excretion of its two major methylated metabolites, N1-methyl-nicotinamide and N1-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide [ 2 ]. Excretion rates in adults of more than 17.5 micromol/day of these two metabolites reflect adequate niacin status, while excretion rates between 5.8 and 17.5 micromol/day reflect low niacin status. An adult has deficient niacin status when urinary excretion rates are less than 5.8 micromol/day. Indicators of inadequacy such as this and other biochemical signs (e.g., a 2-pyridone oxidation product of N1-methyl-nicotinamide below detection limits in plasma or low erythrocyte NAD concentrations) occur well before overt clinical signs of deficiency [ 2 ]. Another measure of niacin status takes into account the fact that NAD levels decline as niacin status deteriorates, whereas NADP levels remain relatively constant [ 1 , 3 , 5 ]. A niacin number (the ratio of NAD to NADP concentrations in whole blood x 100) below 130 suggests niacin deficiency [ 6 , 7 ]. A niacin index (the ratio of erythrocyte NAD to NADP concentrations) below 1 suggests that an individual is at risk of developing niacin deficiency [ 8 ]. No functional biochemical tests that reflect total body stores of niacin are available [ 5 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for niacin and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by an expert committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [ 2 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nTable 1 lists the current RDAs for niacin as mg of niacin equivalents (NE) [ 2 ]. The FNB defines 1 NE as 1 mg niacin or 60 mg of the amino acid tryptophan (which the body can convert to niacin). Niacin RDAs for adults are based on niacin metabolite excretion data. For children and adolescents, niacin RDAs are extrapolated from adult values on the basis of body weight. The AI for infants from birth to 6 months is for niacin alone, as young infants use almost all the protein they consume for growth and development; it is equivalent to the mean intake of niacin in healthy, breastfed infants. For infants age 7–12 months, the AI for niacin is in mg NE and is based on amounts consumed from breast milk and solid foods.\n* Adequate Intake\n",
    "Food": "Niacin is present in a wide variety of foods. Many animal-based foods—including poultry, beef, and fish—provide about 5–10 mg niacin per serving, primarily in the highly bioavailable forms of NAD and NADP [ 3 ]. Plant-based foods, such as nuts, legumes, and grains, provide about 2–5 mg niacin per serving, mainly as nicotinic acid. In some grain products, however, naturally present niacin is largely bound to polysaccharides and glycopeptides that make it only about 30% bioavailable [ 3 , 4 ]. Many breads, cereals, and infant formulas in the United States and many other countries contain added niacin. Niacin that is added to enriched and fortified foods is in its free form and therefore highly bioavailable [ 2 ].\nTryptophan is another food source of niacin because this amino acid—when present in amounts beyond that required for protein synthesis—can be converted to NAD, mainly in the liver [ 3 , 5 ]. The most commonly used estimate of efficiency for tryptophan conversion to NAD is 1:60 (i.e., 1 mg niacin [NAD] from 60 mg tryptophan). Turkey is an example of a food high in tryptophan; a 3-oz portion of turkey breast meat provides about 180 mg tryptophan, which could be equivalent to 3 mg niacin [ 9 ]. However, the efficiency of the conversion of tryptophan to NAD varies considerably in different people [ 3 ].\nTable 2 lists several food sources of niacin.\n* These values are for the niacin content of foods only. They do not include the contribution of tryptophan, some of which is converted to NAD in the body. ** DV = Daily Value. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for niacin is 16 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 10 ]. The FDA does not require food labels to list niacin content unless niacin has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% of more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) FoodData Central lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing niacin arranged by nutrient content .\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "Niacin is available in multivitamin/mineral products, in supplements containing other B-complex vitamins, and in supplements containing niacin only. Nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are the two most common forms of niacin in supplements. Some niacin-only supplements contain 500 mg or more per serving, which is much higher than the RDA for this nutrient [ 11 ].\nNicotinic acid in supplemental amounts beyond nutritional needs can cause skin flushing, so some formulations are manufactured and labeled as prolonged, sustained, extended, or timed release to minimize this unpleasant side effect. Nicotinamide does not produce skin flushing because of its slightly different chemical structure [ 2 , 12 ]. Niacin supplements are also available in the form of inositol hexanicotinate, and these supplements are frequently labeled as being flush free because they do not cause flushing. The absorption of niacin from inositol hexanicotinate varies widely but on average is 30% lower than from nicotinic acid or nicotinamide, which are almost completely absorbed [ 12-14 ]. Two niacin-like compounds, nicotinamide riboside and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN; also referred to as β-NMN), are also available as dietary supplements, but are not marketed or labeled as sources of niacin [ 11 ]. However, FDA ruled in November 2022 that NMN may not be legally marketed as a dietary supplement because it has been authorized for investigation by FDA as a new drug [ 15 ].\n",

    "Cardiovascular disease": "Very high doses of nicotinic acid—more than 100 times the RDA—taken for months or years are effective treatments for dyslipidemias. Nicotinamide does not have this effect because, unlike nicotinic acid, it does not bind to the receptors that mediate nicotinic acid's effects on lipid profiles [ 1 ]. Studies conducted since the late 1950s show that these doses can increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL; good) cholesterol levels by 10%–30% and reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL; bad) cholesterol levels by 10%–25%, triglyceride levels by 20%–50%, and lipoprotein(a) levels by 10%–30% [ 12 ]. Together, these changes in lipid parameters might be expected to reduce the risk of first-time or subsequent cardiac events, such as heart attacks and strokes, in adults with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, despite dozens of published clinical trials, experts do not agree on the value of nicotinic acid to treat cardiovascular disease, especially given its side effects, safety concerns, and poor patient compliance [ 25 ].\nIn one large clinical trial from the 1970s, 8,341 participants age 30 to 64 years who had had one or more heart attacks were randomized to take one of five lipid-lowering medications, including 3,000 mg/day nicotinic acid, or a placebo for an average of 6.2 years [ 26 ]. Those taking nicotinic acid lowered their serum cholesterol levels by an average of 9.9% and triglyceride levels by 26.1% over 5 years of treatment. During 5 to 8.5 years of treatment, these participants had significantly fewer nonfatal myocardial infarctions but more cardiac arrhythmias than those in the placebo group. Their overall rates of mortality and cause-specific mortality, including from coronary heart disease, did not decline. However, 9 years after the study ended, participants who had taken the nicotinic acid experienced significantly fewer (11%) deaths from all causes than those who had taken the placebo [ 27 , 28 ].\nStatin medications have become the treatment of choice for hyperlipidemia and lowering the risks of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. For this reason, clinical trials of nicotinic acid in the past several decades have examined whether it provides any additional cardiovascular protection to people taking statins [ 29 ].\nIn the largest international, multicenter, clinical trial of nicotinic acid to date, 25,673 adults age 50–80 years (83% men) with cardiovascular disease who were taking a statin were randomized to take 2 g/day extended-release nicotinic acid with a medication to reduce nicotinic acid’s flushing effect and therefore improve treatment compliance or a matching placebo for a median of 4 years [ 30 , 31 ]. The nicotinic acid group had a mean reduction in LDL cholesterol (of 10 mg/dl) and triglycerides (of 33 mg/dl) and an increase in HDL cholesterol (of 6 mg/dl), but this group had no significant reduction in rates of major vascular events compared with the placebo (statin-only) group. Furthermore, the nicotinic acid group had a significantly greater risk of diabetes, gastrointestinal dyspepsia, diarrhea, ulceration, bleeding events in the gut and brain, and skin rashes and ulcerations. An earlier randomized clinical trial of 3,414 patients with established cardiovascular disease was stopped after 3 years when the researchers found that patients taking niacin (1,500–2,000 mg/day extended release) in addition to their cholesterol-reduction medications did not have fewer cardiovascular events than those taking medication alone, even though the niacin reduced triglyceride and LDL cholesterol levels further and raised HDL cholesterol levels further [ 32 ]. The results also showed that patients taking niacin had an increased risk of ischemic stroke.\nThe authors of two 2017 systematic reviews examining the clinical trial data concluded that nicotinic acid therapy provides little if any protection from atherosclerotic heart disease, even though the therapy raises HDL cholesterol levels and lowers total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. One of these reviews examined 23 randomized controlled trials of moderate to high quality in 39,195 participants age 33–71 years (average 65 years; majority were male). Some had experienced a heart attack, and most were taking a statin. The doses used and treatment duration in these studies varied widely; the median dose of nicotinic acid was 2 g/day (range 0.5 to 4 g/day) for a median of 11.5 months (range 6 months to 6 years) [ 25 ]. Overall, use of nicotinic acid did not reduce overall mortality or cardiovascular mortality rates or the number of fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarctions or strokes. Eighteen percent of participants taking nicotinic acid discontinued treatment because of side effects. The second review examined 13 randomized controlled trials with 35,206 participants with, or at risk of, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [ 33 ]. Overall, the addition of nicotinic acid supplementation (dose range not specified) to statin therapy taken for a mean of 33 months (with a broad range of 6 to 60 months) did not lead to significant reductions in rates of all-cause or cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Nicotinic acid treatment was associated with a significantly higher risk of gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal adverse events. In addition, four of the studies that examined diabetes as an outcome found that the patients taking niacin had a significantly higher risk of developing the disease.\nA 2018 review of three randomized controlled trials with 29,195 patients found that all-cause mortality increased by 10% more in those who took 1 to 3 g/day extended release nicotinic acid in addition to a statin medication than patients taking the statin alone [ 34 ].\nIn their guidelines for lowering blood cholesterol levels, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association advise that nonstatin therapies, compared with or in addition to statin therapy, do not provide atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk-reduction benefits that outweigh the potential harms of their adverse effects [ 29 ]. When discussing the use of nicotinic acid supplements to reduce the risk of hyperlipidemia (for example, in patients unable to tolerate statin medications), the two professional societies recommend that patients take 500 mg/day extended-release nicotinic acid supplements and increase the dose to a maximum of 2,000 mg/day over 4 to 8 weeks or take 100 mg immediate-release nicotinic acid three times a day and increase the dose to 3,000 mg/day divided into two or three doses. (Their joint statement about monitoring supplement users who take niacin to reduce hyperlipidemia risk for adverse effects is described in the Health Risks from Excessive Niacin section below.) In their 2018 report, these two professional societies stated what although niacin may be useful in some cases of severe hypertriglyceridemia, it has only mild LDL-lowering effects. The societies therefore do not recommend using it as an add-on drug to statin therapy [ 35 ].\nOverall, the evidence indicates that nicotinic acid supplementation improves blood lipid profiles but has no significant effects on risk of cardiovascular events. Although nicotinic acid is a nutrient, if very high doses (thousands of mg) are taken to treat hyperlipidemias, the supplement is being used as a drug. Such doses should only be taken with medical approval and supervision.\n",

    "Niacin Intakes and Status": "Most people in the United States consume more than the RDA for niacin. An analysis of data from the 2015–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that the average daily niacin intake from foods and beverages was 21.4 mg for age 2–19 [ 16 ]. In adults, the average daily niacin intake from foods and beverages was 31.4 mg in men and 21.3 mg in women. An analysis of data from the 2009–2012 NHANES found that only 1% of adults had intakes of niacin from foods and beverages below the EAR [ 17 ]. Among all racial and ethnic groups, Hispanics had the greatest prevalence, 1.3%, of niacin intakes below the EAR [ 18 ].\nAccording to self-reported data from the 2013–2014 NHANES, 21% of all individuals age 2 and older took a dietary supplement containing niacin [ 16 ]. The proportion of users increased with age from 8% of those age 12–19 years to 39% of men and 40% of women age 60 and older. Supplement use doubled or tripled total niacin intakes compared with intakes from diet alone. According to data from the 2003–2006 NHANES, 10% of all individuals age 2 and older who took dietary supplements had total niacin intakes that reached or exceeded the UL [ 19 ].\n",
    "Niacin Deficiency": "Severe niacin deficiency leads to pellagra, a disease characterized by a pigmented rash or brown discoloration on skin exposed to sunlight; the skin also develops a roughened, sunburned-like appearance [ 2 , 4 , 20 , 21 ]. In addition, pellagra can cause a bright red tongue and changes in the digestive tract that lead to vomiting, constipation, or diarrhea. The neurological symptoms of pellagra can include depression; apathy; headache; fatigue; loss of memory that can progress to aggressive, paranoid, and suicidal behaviors; and auditory and visual hallucinations [ 2-4 ]. As pellagra progresses, anorexia develops, and the affected individual eventually dies [ 3 ].\nPellagra is uncommon in industrialized populations and is mostly limited to people living in poverty, such as refugees and displaced people who eat very limited diets low in niacin and protein [ 21 , 22 ]. Pellagra was not uncommon in the early 20th century among individuals living in poverty in the southern United States and parts of Europe whose limited diets consisted mainly of corn [ 2 , 3 ]. The World Health Organization recommends treating pellagra with 300 mg/day nicotinamide in divided doses for 3–4 weeks along with a B-complex or yeast product to treat likely deficiencies in other B vitamins [ 21 ].\nAlthough frank niacin deficiencies leading to pellagra are very rare in the United States, some individuals have marginal or low niacin status [ 2 , 20 , 22 , 23 ].\n",
    "Groups at Risk of Niacin Inadequacy": "Niacin inadequacy usually arises from insufficient intakes of foods containing niacin and tryptophan. It can also be caused by factors that reduce the conversion of tryptophan to niacin, such as low intakes of other nutrients [ 2 , 22 ]. The following groups are among those most likely to have inadequate niacin status.\n",
    "People with undernutrition": "People who are undernourished because they live in poverty or have anorexia, alcohol use disorder, AIDS, inflammatory bowel disease, or liver cirrhosis often have inadequate intakes of niacin and other nutrients [ 2 , 20 , 22 , 23 ].\n",
    "People with inadequate riboflavin, pyridoxine, and/or iron intakes": "People who do not consume enough riboflavin (vitamin B2), pyridoxine (vitamin B6), or iron convert less tryptophan to niacin because enzymes in the metabolic pathway for this conversion depend on these nutrients to function [ 2 , 22 ].\n",
    "People with Hartnup disease": "Hartnup disease is a rare genetic disorder involving the renal, intestinal, and cellular transport processes for several amino acids, including tryptophan. The disease interferes with the absorption of tryptophan in the small intestine and increases its loss in the urine via the kidneys [ 2 , 23 , 24 ]. As a result, the body has less available tryptophan to convert to niacin.\n",
    "People with carcinoid syndrome": "Carcinoid syndrome is caused by slow-growing tumors in the gastrointestinal tract that release serotonin and other substances. It is characterized by facial flushing, diarrhea, and other symptoms. In those with carcinoid syndrome, tryptophan is preferentially oxidized to serotonin and not metabolized to niacin [ 2 ]. As a result, the body has less available tryptophan to convert to niacin.\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Niacin": "No adverse effects have been reported from the consumption of naturally occurring niacin in foods [ 2 ]. However, high intakes of both nicotinic acid and nicotinamide taken as a dietary supplement or medication can cause adverse effects, although their toxicity profiles are not the same.\nThirty to 50 mg or more nicotinic acid typically causes flushing; the skin on the patient’s face, arms, and chest turns a reddish color because of vasodilation of small subcutaneous blood vessels. The flushing is accompanied by burning, tingling, and itching sensations [ 2 , 12 , 36 ]. These signs and symptoms are typically transient and can occur within 30 minutes of intake or over days or weeks with repeated dosing; they are considered an unpleasant, rather than a toxic, side effect. However, the flushing can be accompanied by more serious signs and symptoms, such as headache, rash, dizziness, and/or a decrease in blood pressure. Supplement users can reduce the flushing effects by taking nicotinic acid supplements with food, slowly increasing the dose over time, or simply waiting for the body to develop a natural tolerance.\nWhen taken in pharmacologic doses of 1,000 to 3,000 mg/day, nicotinic acid can also cause more serious adverse effects [ 2 , 4 , 12 , 36 ]. Many of these effects have occurred in patients taking high-dose nicotinic acid supplements to treat hyperlipidemias. These adverse effects can include hypotension severe enough to increase the risk of falls; fatigue; impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance; gastrointestinal effects, such as nausea, heartburn, and abdominal pain; and ocular effects, such as blurred or impaired vision and macular edema (a buildup of fluid at the center of the retina). High doses of nicotinic acid taken over months or years can also be hepatotoxic; effects can include increased levels of liver enzymes; hepatic dysfunction resulting in fatigue, nausea, and anorexia; hepatitis; and acute liver failure [ 2 , 12 , 29 , 37 ]. Hepatotoxicity is more likely to occur with the use of extended-release forms of nicotinic acid [ 12 , 38 , 39 ].\nTo minimize the risk of adverse effects from nicotinic acid supplementation or to identify them before they become serious, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommend measuring hepatic transaminase, fasting blood glucose or hemoglobin A1C, and uric acid levels in all supplement users before they start therapy, while the dose is being increased to a maintenance level, and every 6 months thereafter [ 29 ]. The societies also recommend that patients not use nicotinic acid supplements or stop using them if their hepatic transaminase levels are more than two or three times the upper limits of normal; if they develop persistent hyperglycemia, acute gout, unexplained abdominal pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, new-onset atrial fibrillation, or weight loss; or if they have persistent and severe skin reactions, such as flushing or rashes.\nNicotinamide does not cause skin flushing and has fewer adverse effects than nicotinic acid, and these effects typically begin with much higher doses [ 12 ]. Nausea, vomiting, and signs of liver toxicity can occur with nicotinamide intakes of 3,000 mg/day [ 2 ]. In several small studies of participants undergoing hemodialysis, the most common adverse effects from 500–1,500 mg/day nicotinamide supplementation for several months were diarrhea and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) [ 36 , 40-42 ].\nThe FNB has established ULs for niacin that apply only to supplemental niacin for healthy infants, children, and adults [ 2 ]. These ULs are based on the levels associated with skin flushing. The FNB acknowledges that although excess nicotinamide does not cause flushing, a UL for nicotinic acid based on flushing can prevent the potential adverse effects of nicotinamide [ 2 ]. The UL, therefore, applies to both forms of supplemental niacin. However, the UL does not apply to individuals who are receiving supplemental niacin under medical supervision [ 2 ].\n* Breast milk, formula, and food should be the only sources of niacin for infants.\n",
    "Isoniazid and pyrazinamide": "Isoniazid and pyrazinamide (together in Rifater), used to treat tuberculosis, are structural analogs of niacin and interrupt the production of niacin from tryptophan by competing with a vitamin B6-dependent enzyme required for this process [ 2 , 22 ]. In addition, isoniazid can interfere with niacin's conversion to NAD [ 43 ]. Although pellagra can occur in patients with tuberculosis treated with isoniazid, it can be prevented with increased intakes of niacin.\n",
    "Antidiabetes medications": "Large doses of nicotinic acid can raise blood glucose levels by causing or aggravating insulin resistance and increasing hepatic production of glucose [ 43 ]. Some studies have found that nicotinic acid doses of 1.5 g/day or more are most likely to increase blood glucose levels in individuals with or without diabetes [ 38 ]. People who take any antidiabetes medications should have their blood glucose levels monitored if they take high-dose nicotinic acid supplements concomitantly because they might require dose adjustments [ 43 ].\n",
    "Niacin and Healthful Diets": "The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Many vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and dairy products provide some niacin. Enriched grains are also a source of niacin. Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. Fish, beef, chicken, and turkey are good sources of niacin. Many legumes, nuts, seeds, and soy products provide some niacin. Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Limits alcoholic beverages. Stays within your daily calorie needs.\nMany vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and dairy products provide some niacin.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet .\n",
    "Introduction": "Pantothenic acid (also known as vitamin B5) is an essential nutrient that is naturally present in some foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. The main function of this water-soluble B vitamin is in the synthesis of coenzyme A (CoA) and acyl carrier protein [ 1 , 2 ]. CoA is essential for fatty acid synthesis and degradation, transfer of acetyl and acyl groups, and a multitude of other anabolic and catabolic processes [ 3 , 4 ]. Acyl carrier protein’s main role is in fatty acid synthesis [ 2 ].\nA wide variety of plant and animal foods contain pantothenic acid [ 1 ]. About 85% of dietary pantothenic acid is in the form of CoA or phosphopantetheine [ 2 , 4 ]. These forms are converted to pantothenic acid by digestive enzymes (nucleosidases, peptidases, and phosphorylases) in the intestinal lumen and intestinal cells. Pantothenic acid is absorbed in the intestine and delivered directly into the bloodstream by active transport (and possibly simple diffusion at higher doses) [ 1 , 2 , 4 ]. Pantetheine, the dephosphorylated form of phosphopantetheine, however, is first taken up by intestinal cells and converted to pantothenic acid before being delivered into the bloodstream [ 2 ]. The intestinal flora also produce pantothenic acid, but its contribution to the total amount of pantothenic acid that the body absorbs is not known [ 4 ]. Red blood cells carry pantothenic acid throughout the body [ 4 ]. Most pantothenic acid in tissues is in the form of CoA, but smaller amounts are present as acyl carrier protein or free pantothenic acid [ 1 , 4 ].\nPantothenic acid status is not routinely measured in healthy people. Microbiologic growth assays, animal bioassays, and radioimmunoassays can be used to measure pantothenic concentrations in blood, urine, and tissue, but urinary concentrations are the most reliable indicators because of their close relationship with dietary intake [ 1 , 4 ]. With a typical American diet, the urinary excretion rate for pantothenic acid is about 2.6 mg/day [ 3 , 5 ]. Excretion of less than 1 mg pantothenic acid per day suggests deficiency [ 1 , 6 ]. Like urinary concentrations, whole-blood concentrations of pantothenic acid correlate with pantothenic acid intake, but measuring pantothenic acid in whole blood requires enzyme pretreatment to release free pantothenic acid from CoA [ 1 ]. Normal blood concentrations of pantothenic acid range from 1.6 to 2.7 mcmol/L, and blood concentrations below 1 mcmol/L are considered low and suggest deficiency [ 1 , 4 ]. Unlike whole-blood concentrations, plasma levels of pantothenic acid do not correlate well with changes in intake or status [ 1 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for pantothenic acid and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [ 3 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nWhen the FNB evaluated the available data, it found the data insufficient to derive an EAR for pantothenic acid. Consequently, the FNB established AIs for all ages based on usual pantothenic acid intakes in healthy populations [ 3 ]. Table 1 lists the current AIs for pantothenic acid [ 3 ].\n",
    "Food": "Almost all plant- and animal-based foods contain pantothenic acid in varying amounts. Some of the richest dietary sources are beef, chicken, organ meats, whole grains, and some vegetables [ 4 ]. Pantothenic acid is added to various foods, including some breakfast cereals and beverages (such as energy drinks) [ 4 ]. Limited data indicate that the body absorbs 40%–61% (or half, on average) of pantothenic acid from foods [ 5 ].\nEdible animal and plant tissues contain relatively high concentrations of pantothenic acid. Food processing, however, can cause significant losses of this compound (20% to almost 80%) [ 1 ].\nSeveral food sources of pantothenic acid are listed in Table 2.\n*DV = Daily Value. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for pantothenic acid is 5 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 8 ]. FDA does not require food labels to list pantothenic acid content unless pantothenic acid has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) FoodData Central [ 7 ] lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing pantothenic acid arranged by nutrient content .\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "Pantothenic acid is available in dietary supplements containing only pantothenic acid, in combination with other B-complex vitamins, and in some multivitamin/multimineral products [ 9 ]. Some supplements contain pantethine (a dimeric form of pantetheine) or more commonly, calcium pantothenate [ 4 , 9-11 ]. No studies have compared the relative bioavailability of pantothenic acid from these different forms. The amount of pantothenic acid in dietary supplements typically ranges from about 10 mg in multivitamin/multimineral products to up to 1,000 mg in supplements of B-complex vitamins or pantothenic acid alone [ 9 ].\n",

    "Pantothenic Acid Intakes and Status": "Few data on pantothenic acid intakes in the United States are available. However, a typical mixed diet in the United States provides an estimated daily intake of about 6 mg, suggesting that most people in the United States consume adequate amounts [ 12 ]. Some intake information is available from other Western populations. For example, a 1996–1997 study in New Brunswick, Canada, found average daily pantothenic acid intakes of 4.0 mg in women and 5.5 mg in men [ 13 ].\n",
    "Pantothenic Acid Deficiency": "Because some pantothenic acid is present in almost all foods, deficiency is rare except in people with severe malnutrition [ 1 , 4 ]. When someone has a pantothenic acid deficiency, it is usually accompanied by deficiencies in other nutrients, making it difficult to identify the effects that are specific to pantothenic acid deficiency [ 1 ]. The only individuals known to have developed pantothenic acid deficiency were fed diets containing virtually no pantothenic acid or were taking a pantothenic acid metabolic antagonist [ 3 ].\nOn the basis of the experiences of prisoners of war in World War II and studies of diets lacking pantothenic acid in conjunction with administration of an antagonist of pantothenic acid metabolism, a deficiency is associated with numbness and burning of the hands and feet, headache, fatigue, irritability, restlessness, disturbed sleep, and gastrointestinal disturbances with anorexia [ 1 , 4 , 6 , 14 , 15 ].\n",
    "Groups at Risk of Pantothenic Acid Inadequacy": "The following group is most likely to have inadequate pantothenic acid status.\n",
    "People with a pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration 2 mutation": "Pantothenic acid kinase is an enzyme that is essential for CoA and phosphopantetheine production. It is the principle enzyme associated with the metabolic pathway that is responsible for CoA synthesis. Mutations in the pantothenate kinase 2 (PANK2) gene cause a rare, inherited disorder, pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN). PKAN is a type of neurodegeneration associated with brain iron accumulation [ 4 ]. A large number of PANK2 mutations reduce the activity of pantothenate kinase 2, potentially decreasing the conversion of pantothenic acid to CoA and thus reducing CoA levels [ 2 ].\nThe manifestations of PKAN can include dystonia (contractions of opposing groups of muscles), spasticity, and pigmentary retinopathy [ 2 , 4 , 16 ]. Its progression is rapid and leads to significant disability and loss of function [ 16 ]. Treatment focuses primarily on reducing symptoms [ 17 ]. Whether pantothenate supplementation is beneficial in PKAN is not known, but some anecdotal reports indicate that supplements can reduce symptoms in some patients with atypical PKAN [ 18 ].\n",
    "Hyperlipidemia": "Because of pantothenic acid’s role in triglyceride synthesis and lipoprotein metabolism, experts have hypothesized that pantothenic acid supplementation might reduce lipid levels in patients with hyperlipidemia [ 19 ].\nSeveral clinical trials have shown that the form of pantothenic acid known as pantethine reduces lipid levels when taken in large amounts [ 20 ], but pantothenic acid itself does not appear to have the same effects [ 1 ]. A 2005 review included 28 small clinical trials (average sample size of 22 participants) that examined the effect of pantethine supplements (median daily dose of 900 mg for an average of 12.7 weeks) on serum lipid levels in a total of 646 adults with hyperlipidemia [ 20 ]. On average, the supplements were associated with triglyceride declines of 14.2% at 1 month and 32.9% at 4 months. The corresponding declines in total cholesterol were 8.7% and 15.1%, and for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were 10.4% and 20.1%. The corresponding increases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were 6.1% and 8.4%.\nA few additional clinical trials have assessed pantethine’s effects on lipid levels since the publication of the 2005 review. A double-blind trial in China randomly assigned 216 adults with hypertriglyceridemia (204–576 mg/dl) to supplementation with 400 U/day CoA or 600 mg/day pantethine [ 21 ]. All participants also received dietary counseling. Triglyceride levels dropped by a significant 16.5% with pantethine compared with baseline after 8 weeks. Concentrations of total cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol also declined modestly but significantly from baseline. However, these declines might have been due, at least in part, to the dietary counseling that the participants received.\nTwo randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled studies by the same research group in a total of 152 adults with low to moderate cardiovascular disease risk found that 600 mg/day pantethine for 8 weeks followed by 900 mg/day for 8 weeks plus a therapeutic lifestyle change diet resulted in small but significant reductions in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol compared with placebo after 16 weeks [ 19 , 22 ]. Increasing the amount of pantethine from 600 to 900 mg/day did not increase the magnitude of reduction in the lipid measures.\nAdditional studies are needed to determine whether pantethine supplementation has a beneficial effect on hyperlipidemia independently of, and together with, eating a heart-healthy diet. Research is also needed to determine the mechanisms of pantethine’s effects on lipid levels.\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Pantothenic Acid": "The FNB was unable to establish ULs for pantothenic acid because there are no reports of pantothenic acid toxicity in humans at high intakes. Some individuals taking large doses of pantothenic acid supplements (e.g., 10 g/day) develop mild diarrhea and gastrointestinal distress, but the mechanism for this effect is not known [ 1 , 23 ].\n",
    "Pantothenic Acid and Healthful Diets": "The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Many vegetables, whole grains, and dairy products contain pantothenic acid. Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. ​​​​​​​Fish, beef, poultry, eggs, beans, and nuts contain pantothenic acid. Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Limits alcoholic beverages. Stays within your daily calorie needs.\nMany vegetables, whole grains, and dairy products contain pantothenic acid.\n​​​​​​​Fish, beef, poultry, eggs, beans, and nuts contain pantothenic acid.\n",

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet .\n",
    "Introduction": "Phosphorus, an essential mineral, is naturally present in many foods and available as a dietary supplement. Phosphorus is a component of bones, teeth, DNA, and RNA [ 1 ]. In the form of phospholipids, phosphorus is also a component of cell membrane structure and of the body’s key energy source, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Many proteins and sugars in the body are phosphorylated. In addition, phosphorus plays key roles in regulation of gene transcription, activation of enzymes, maintenance of normal pH in extracellular fluid, and intracellular energy storage. In humans, phosphorus makes up about 1% to 1.4% of fat-free mass. Of this amount, 85% is in bones and teeth, and the other 15% is distributed throughout the blood and soft tissues [ 1 ].\nMany different types of foods contain phosphorus, mainly in the form of phosphates and phosphate esters [ 1 ]. However, phosphorus in seeds and unleavened breads is in the form of phytic acid, the storage form of phosphorus [ 2 ]. Because human intestines lack the phytase enzyme, much phosphorus in this form is unavailable for absorption [ 1 ]. Phosphorus undergoes passive absorption in the small intestine, although some is absorbed by active transport [ 2 ].\nPhosphorus and calcium are interrelated because hormones, such as vitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH), regulate the metabolism of both minerals. In addition, phosphorus and calcium make up hydroxyapatite, the main structural component in bones and tooth enamel [ 3 ]. The combination of high phosphorus intakes with low calcium intakes increases serum PTH levels, but evidence is mixed on whether the increased hormone levels decrease bone mineral density [ 2 , 4-6 ].\nThe kidneys, bones, and intestines regulate phosphorus homeostasis, which requires maintenance of urinary losses at equivalent levels to net phosphorus absorption and ensuring that equal amounts of phosphorus are deposited and resorbed from bone [ 1 , 7 , 8 ]. Several hormones, including estrogen and adrenaline, also affect phosphorus homeostasis. When kidney function declines, as in chronic kidney failure, the body cannot excrete phosphate efficiently, and serum levels rise [ 9 ].\nAlthough phosphorus status is not typically assessed, phosphate can be measured in both serum and plasma [ 10 ]. In adults, normal phosphate concentration in serum or plasma is 2.5 to 4.5 mg/dL (0.81 to 1.45 mmol/L) [ 10 ]. Hypophosphatemia is defined as serum phosphate concentrations lower than the low end of the normal range, whereas a concentration higher than the high end of the range indicates hyperphosphatemia. However, plasma and serum phosphate levels do not necessarily reflect whole-body phosphorus content [ 1 , 11 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for phosphorus and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [ 12 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nTable 1 lists the current RDAs for phosphorus [ 2 ]. For infants from birth to 12 months, the FNB established an AI for phosphorus that is equivalent to the mean intake of phosphorus in healthy, breastfed infants.\n*Adequate Intake (AI)\n",
    "Food": "Many different types of foods contain phosphorus, including dairy products, meats and poultry, fish, eggs, nuts, legumes, vegetables, and grains [ 13 , 14 ]. In the United States, dairy products contribute about 20% of total phosphorus intakes, and bakery products (e.g., breads, tortillas, and sweet bakery products) contribute 10% [ 13 ]. Vegetables and chicken contribute 5% each. The absorption rate for the phosphorus naturally contained in food is 40%–70%; phosphorus from animal sources has a higher absorption rate than that from plants [ 15 , 16 ]. Calcium from foods and supplements can bind to some of the phosphorus in foods and prevent its absorption [ 1 , 17 ]. According to one analysis, a very high calcium intake of 2,500 mg/day binds 0.61–1.05 g phosphorus [ 17 ]. In infants, phosphorus bioavailability ranges from 85%–90% for human milk to approximately 59% for soy-based formulas [ 2 ].\nPhosphate additives (e.g., phosphoric acid, sodium phosphate, and sodium polyphosphate) are present in many foods, especially processed food products. These additives are used for such purposes as preserving moisture or color and enhancing and stabilizing frozen foods [ 18 ]. Foods containing these additives have an average of 67 mg more phosphorus per serving than similar foods not containing the additives, and these additives contribute to overall phosphorus intakes in the United States [ 18 , 19 ].\nPhosphate additives are estimated to contribute 300 to 1,000 mg to total daily phosphorus intakes [ 11 , 20 ], or about 10%–50% of phosphorus intakes in Western countries [ 21 ]. The use of phosphate additives is rising, as are the amounts of these additives in foods [ 22 , 23 ]. The absorption rate for the phosphorus in phosphate additives is approximately 70% [ 24 ].\nSeveral food sources of phosphorus are listed in Table 2.\n*DV = Daily Value. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for phosphorus is 1,250 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 26 ]. FDA does not require food labels to list phosphorus content unless phosphorus has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) FoodData Central [ 27 ] lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing phosphorus arranged by nutrient content.\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "Phosphorus is available in dietary supplements containing only phosphorus, supplements containing phosphorus in combination with other ingredients, and a few multivitamin/mineral products [ 28 ]. Phosphorus in supplements is usually in the form of phosphate salts (e.g., dipotassium phosphate or disodium phosphate) or phospholipids (e.g., phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylserine). Products typically provide 10% or less of the DV for phosphorus, but a small proportion deliver more than 100% [ 28 ].\nThe bioavailability of phosphate salts is approximately 70% [ 15 , 24 ]. The bioavailability of other forms of phosphorus in supplements has not been determined in humans.\n",

    "Cardiovascular disease": "Several observational studies support a link between high phosphate levels and CVD risk in people with and without a history of CVD [ 56 , 57 ]. For example, an analysis of 14,675 participants (55% women) without atrial fibrillation found, based on almost 20 years of follow-up, that each 1 mg/dL increase in serum phosphate was associated with a 13% higher risk of atrial fibrillation [ 58 ].\nSeveral large epidemiologic studies have also found associations between higher serum phosphate concentrations and risk of cardiovascular mortality in healthy adults. A meta-analysis of data from four prospective cohort studies with 13,515 participants (with percentages of male participants ranging, depending on the study, from 44 to 100% and mean ages from 43 to 74 years) followed for 6–29 years showed a 36% higher risk of cardiovascular mortality in those with the highest phosphate concentration (2.79–4.0 mg/dL) compared with participants with a phosphate concentration of 0.61–3.28 mg/dL [ 59 ]. A subsequent study not included in this meta-analysis in 13,165 nonpregnant adult participants (mean age 43–45 years, 52% female) in NHANES III (1988–1994) followed for a median of 14.3 years found that for every 1 mg/dL increase in phosphate above 3.5 mg/dL, the risk of death rose by 35% and the risk of cardiovascular death increased by 45% [ 60 ].\nNot all observational data, however, support a link between serum phosphate concentrations and CVD risk. A post hoc analysis of data from 7,269 postmenopausal women, mean age 66 years, with osteoporosis found no association between higher serum phosphate levels and risk of cardiovascular outcomes during 4 years of follow-up [ 61 ].\nIn spite of the evidence supporting a link between increased phosphate levels and CVD risk, the literature offers no evidence on whether restricting phosphorus consumption can prevent CVD in healthy adults [ 62 ]. Additional research is needed to address this issue.\n",

    "Phosphorus Intakes and Status": "Most Americans consume more than the recommended amounts of phosphorus. Data from the 2015–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) show that among children and teens age 2–19 years, the average daily phosphorus intake from foods is 1,237 mg [ 29 ]. In adults age 20 and older, the average daily phosphorus intake from foods is 1,189 mg for women and 1,596 mg for men.\nAccording to an analysis of 2013–2014 NHANES data, the average daily phosphorus intake from both foods and supplements is 1,301 mg for women and 1,744 mg for men [ 30 ]. Some experts question whether the dietary data collection instruments used by NHANES and other large population-based studies capture true dietary phosphorus intakes because these surveys do not account for the additional contributions of phosphate additives in foods [ 31 , 32 ].\n",
    "Phosphorus Deficiency": "Phosphorus deficiency (hypophosphatemia) is rare in the United States and is almost never the result of low dietary intakes [ 1 ]. The effects of hypophosphatemia can include anorexia, anemia, proximal muscle weakness, skeletal effects (bone pain, rickets, and osteomalacia), increased infection risk, paresthesias, ataxia, and confusion [ 1 ]. In most cases, hypophosphatemia is caused by medical conditions, such as hyperparathyroidism, kidney tubule defects, and diabetic ketoacidosis [ 33 ].\n",
    "Groups at Risk of Phosphorus Inadequacy": "The following groups are most likely to have inadequate phosphorus status.\n",
    "Preterm newborns": "Phosphorus deficiency in preterm infants is one of the main causes, along with calcium deficiency, of osteopenia of prematurity (impaired bone mineralization) [ 34 ]. Because two-thirds of fetal bone mineral content is acquired during the third trimester of pregnancy, preterm infants are born with low stores of calcium and phosphorus in their bones [ 35 ]. The benefits of providing extra phosphorus and calcium for bone health in preterm babies is not clear. However, milk fortified with higher amounts of these minerals and other nutritional components is typically recommended to support overall growth and development [ 35 , 36 ].\n",
    "People with genetic phosphate regulation disorders": "Rare genetic disorders of phosphorus metabolism include X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets [ 37 ]. In addition to rickets, patients with this disease develop osteomalacia, pseudofractures (formation of new bone and thickened connective tissue over injured bone), enthesopathy (mineralization of ligaments and tendons), and dental damage. Other rare genetic disorders of phosphorus regulation associated with rickets include autosomal-dominant and autosomal-recessive hypophosphatemic rickets and hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria [ 38 ]. Treatment typically consists of vitamin D and phosphorus supplementation from diagnosis until growth is complete [ 39 ].\n",
    "Patients with severe malnutrition": "People with severe protein or calorie malnutrition can develop refeeding syndrome, also known as refeeding hypophosphatemia, within 2 to 5 days of starting enteral or parenteral nutrition because of the shift in metabolism from a catabolic to an anabolic state [ 40 , 41 ]. Causes of malnutrition that can lead to refeeding syndrome include chronic diseases (e.g., cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or cirrhosis), very low birthweight, cachexia, low body weight, anorexia nervosa, excessive alcohol intake, and chewing or swallowing problems. The effects of refeeding syndrome can include impaired neuromuscular function, hypoventilation, respiratory failure, impaired blood clotting, confusion, coma, cardiac arrest, congestive heart failure, and death [ 41 ]. Prophylactic administration of phosphorus and thiamin in patients at risk of refeeding syndrome can prevent this condition [ 41 ].\n",
    "Phosphorus and Health": "This section focuses on two diseases in which phosphorus might play a role: chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD).\n",
    "Chronic kidney disease": "CKD, which affects 5%–10% of the population worldwide, can lead to CVD and early death [ 42 ]. As kidney function declines, phosphate excretion becomes less efficient and serum phosphate concentration rises. As a result, PTH and fibroblast growth factor 23 lose their ability to suppress phosphorus resorption by the kidneys [ 43 ].\nIncreased phosphorus retention often leads to CKD mineral and bone disorder. This systemic condition is characterized by abnormal metabolism of phosphorus, calcium, PTH, and/or vitamin D; abnormal bone turnover, mineralization, volume, growth, or strength; and vascular or other soft-tissue calcification [ 44 ].\nAn analysis of 2003–2006 NHANES data illustrates the association between CKD and phosphate levels. In 7,895 adults (mean age 47 years, 52% Caucasian), participants with reduced kidney function had significantly higher serum phosphate levels (4.12 mg/dL) than those with normal kidney function (3.83 mg/dL) [ 45 ].\nSeveral studies have shown an increased risk of mortality or disease progression in patients who have CKD and high phosphate levels [ 46-48 ]. A meta-analysis of nine cohort studies in 199,289 patients age 50–73 years with end-stage renal disease showed, for example, that patients on dialysis with the highest phosphate levels (greater than 5.2–7.5 mg/dL, depending on the study) had a 39% greater risk of all-cause mortality during 12 to 97.6 months of follow-up than those with normal phosphate levels (defined in the analysis as 3.0–5.5 mg/dL, depending on the study) [ 49 ].\nHowever, high phosphate levels do not seem to have the same associations in people with milder CKD [ 50 , 51 ]. For example, an analysis of NHANES III (1988–1994) data on 1,105 adults (mean age 67–71 years, depending on their phosphate intake tertile) with moderate CKD found that serum phosphate levels were very similar, regardless of phosphate intake—3.6 mg/dL in the lowest tertile of phosphorus intake (532 mg/day) and 3.5 mg/dL in the highest intake tertile (1,478 mg/day)—and that high phosphorus intakes were not associated with increased mortality rates over 6–12 years, possibly because these patients did not have severe CKD [ 51 ].\nTo prevent the complications of high phosphate levels in patients with CKD, clinicians sometimes encourage patients to limit their phosphorus intakes (e.g., by replacing most animal proteins in their diets with plant-based protein sources, whose phosphorus is less bioavailable) and eat more calcium-rich foods [ 9 , 52 ]. Some evidence shows that replacing foods containing phosphorus additives with foods that lack these additives can reduce serum phosphate levels [ 53 ]. However, restricting phosphorus intakes can also reduce protein intakes because many foods (e.g., fish, meats, and legumes) containing large amounts of phosphorus also contain large amounts of protein [ 54 ]. Furthermore, a Cochrane Review of nine studies in 634 participants with CKD followed for 1–18 months found only limited, low-quality evidence indicating that dietary interventions might have a positive impact on CKD mineral and bone disorder [ 43 ].\nIn its clinical practice guideline for CKD mineral and bone disorder, the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines development group recommends that patients with stage 3–5 (more severe) CKD limit dietary phosphorus intake either alone or in combination with other treatments to reduce phosphate levels [ 55 ]. However, the group notes that clinical trial data showing that treatments that lower serum phosphate levels improve patient-centered outcomes are lacking, and it acknowledges that this recommendation is weak.\nAdditional studies are needed on the link between phosphate concentrations and both CKD risk and morbidity in patients with CKD as well as the impact of dietary phosphorus restriction in patients with this disease.\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Phosphorus": "High phosphorus intakes rarely produce adverse effects in healthy people. Although some studies have found associations between high phosphorus intakes (1,000 mg/day or higher) and cardiovascular, kidney, and bone adverse effects as well as an increased risk of death [ 23 , 63 , 66 ], others have found no link between high intakes and increased disease risk [ 5 , 65 , 66 ]. The ULs for phosphorus from food and supplements for healthy individuals are therefore based on intakes associated with normal serum phosphate concentrations [ 2 ]. The ULs do not apply to individuals who are receiving supplemental phosphorus under medical supervision.\n* Breast milk, formula, and food should be the only sources of phosphorus for infants.\nAccording to one analysis of data on healthy U.S. adults using NHANES III data collected in 1988–1994, high phosphorus intakes (1,000 mg/day or more) were associated with increased rates of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in adults through 2006 [ 63 ]. These intakes are twice the RDA for adults—less than daily intakes in many men (especially those who are white or Hispanic) and well below the UL. The implications of this analysis for the potential adverse effects of high phosphorus intakes are unclear. High phosphorus intakes might be signs of diets that are unhealthy in other ways, for example [ 63 ].\nVery high phosphorus intakes over short periods (e.g., two 6,600 mg doses of sodium phosphate taken in 1 day) can cause hyperphosphatemia [ 67 , 68 ]. The main effects of hyperphosphatemia include changes in the hormones that regulate calcium metabolism and calcification of nonskeletal tissues, especially in the kidney [ 2 ].\n",
    "Antacids": "Antacids that contain aluminum hydroxide, such as Maalox HRF and Rulox, bind phosphorus in the intestines, and their chronic use for 3 months or longer can therefore lead to hypophosphatemia [ 1 , 69 ]. These drugs can also aggravate existing phosphate deficiency. Antacids containing calcium carbonate (Rolaids, Tums, Maalox) also decrease instestinal absorption of dietary phosphorus [ 70 ].\n",
    "Laxatives": "Some laxatives, such as Fleet Prep Kit #1, contain sodium phosphate, and ingesting these products can increase serum phosphate levels [ 71 ]. After 13 reports of deaths associated with taking one dose that was higher than recommended on the label of a laxative containing sodium phosphate, FDA issued a warning that these products are potentially dangerous if more than recommended doses are taken, especially in people with kidney disease, heart disease, or dehydration [ 72 ].\n",
    "Phosphorus and Healthful Diets": "The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Some dairy products are rich in phosphorus, and some vegetables, fruits, and grains contain phosphorus. Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. Some meats, seafoods, fish, and nuts and seeds are rich in phosphorus or are good sources of the mineral, and other types of meats, fish, and beans contain phosphorus. Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Limits alcoholic beverages. Stays within your daily calorie needs.\nSome dairy products are rich in phosphorus, and some vegetables, fruits, and grains contain phosphorus.\nSome meats, seafoods, fish, and nuts and seeds are rich in phosphorus or are good sources of the mineral, and other types of meats, fish, and beans contain phosphorus.\n",

    "Table of Contents": "Introduction Recommended Intakes Sources of Potassium Potassium Intakes and Status Potassium Deficiency Groups at Risk of Potassium Inadequacy Potassium and Health Health Risks from Excessive Potassium Interactions with Medications Potassium and Healthful Diets References Disclaimer\nThis is a fact sheet intended for health professionals.  For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet .\n",
    "Introduction": "Potassium, the most abundant intracellular cation, is an essential nutrient that is naturally present in many foods and available as a dietary supplement. Potassium is present in all body tissues and is required for normal cell function because of its role in maintaining intracellular fluid volume and transmembrane electrochemical gradients [ 1 , 2 ]. Potassium has a strong relationship with sodium, the main regulator of extracellular fluid volume, including plasma volume.\nThe total amount of potassium in the adult body is about 45 millimole (mmol)/kg body weight (about 140 g for a 175 pound adult; 1 mmol = 1 milliequivalent [mEq] or 39.1 mg potassium) [ 3 ]. Most potassium resides intracellularly, and a small amount is in extracellular fluid [ 2-4 ]. The intracellular concentration of potassium is about 30 times higher than the extracellular concentration, and this difference forms a transmembrane electrochemical gradient that is maintained via the sodium-potassium (Na+/K+) ATPase transporter [ 4 ]. In addition to maintaining cellular tonicity, this gradient is required for proper nerve transmission, muscle contraction, and kidney function.\nPotassium is absorbed via passive diffusion, primarily in the small intestine [ 2 , 4 , 5 ]. About 90% of ingested potassium is absorbed and used to maintain its normal intracellular and extracellular concentrations [ 3 , 5 ]. Potassium is excreted primarily in the urine, some is excreted in the stool, and a very small amount is lost in sweat. The kidneys control potassium excretion in response to changes in dietary intakes, and potassium excretion increases rapidly in healthy people after potassium consumption, unless body stores are depleted [ 2 , 6 ]. The kidneys can adapt to variable potassium intakes in healthy individuals, but a minimum of 5 mmol (about 195 mg) potassium is excreted daily in urine [ 3 ]. This, combined with other obligatory losses, suggests that potassium balance cannot be achieved with intakes less than about 400–800 mg/day.\nNormal serum concentrations of potassium range from about 3.6 to 5.0 mmol/L and are regulated by a variety of mechanisms [ 3 , 7 ]. Diarrhea, vomiting, kidney disease, use of certain medications, and other conditions that alter potassium excretion or cause transcellular potassium shifts can cause hypokalemia (serum levels below 3.6 mmol/L) or hyperkalemia (serum levels above 5.0 mmol/L) [ 3 , 5 , 7 , 8 ]. Otherwise, in healthy individuals with normal kidney function, abnormally low or high blood levels of potassium are rare.\nAssessing potassium status is not routinely done in clinical practice, and it is difficult to do because most potassium in the body is inside cells. Although blood potassium levels can provide some indication of potassium status, they often correlate poorly with tissue potassium stores [ 3 , 9 , 10 ]. Other methods to measure potassium status include collecting balance data (measuring net potassium retention and loss); measuring the total amount of potassium or the total amount of exchangeable potassium in the body; and conducting tissue analyses (e.g., muscle biopsies), but all have limitations [ 9 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for potassium and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by expert committees of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) [ 11 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nIn 2019, a NASEM committee updated the DRIs for potassium (and sodium) [ 11 ]. The committee found the data insufficient to derive an EAR for potassium. Therefore, they established AIs for all ages based on the highest median potassium intakes in healthy children and adults and on estimates of potassium intakes from breast milk and complementary foods in infants. Table 1 lists the current AIs for potassium for healthy individuals.\n*The AIs do not apply to individuals with impaired potassium excretion because of medical conditions (e.g., kidney disease) or the use of medications that impair potassium excretion.\nThe NASEM committee also used an expanded DRI model to include a recommended intake level for a nutrient to reduce the risk of chronic disease, what they termed the chronic disease risk reduction intake (CDRR) [ 11 , 12 ]. According to the model, a CDRR might be set for a nutrient like potassium when there is a causal relationship between a certain level of intake and a reduced risk of chronic disease based on evidence of at least moderate strength. However, the committee found the evidence to be insufficient to derive a CDRR for potassium.\n",
    "Food": "Potassium is found in a wide variety of plant and animal foods and in beverages. Many fruits and vegetables are excellent sources, as are some legumes (e.g., soybeans) and potatoes. Meats, poultry, fish, milk, yogurt, and nuts also contain potassium [ 3 , 5 ]. Among starchy foods, whole-wheat flour and brown rice are much higher in potassium than their refined counterparts, white wheat flour and white rice [ 13 ].\nMilk, coffee, tea, other nonalcoholic beverages, and potatoes are the top sources of potassium in the diets of U.S. adults [ 14 ]. Among children in the United States, milk, fruit juice, potatoes, and fruit are the top sources [ 15 ].\nIt is estimated that the body absorbs about 85%–90% of dietary potassium [ 1 , 2 ]. The forms of potassium in fruits and vegetables include potassium phosphate, sulfate, citrate and others but not potassium chloride (the form used in salt substitutes and some dietary supplements; see supplements section below) [ 16 ].\nSelected food sources of potassium are listed in Table 2.\n*DV = Daily Value. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for potassium is 4,700 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 17 ]. FDA requires the new food labels to list potassium content. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA's) FoodData Central [ 13 ] lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing potassium ordered by nutrient content. The 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans also provides a list of foods containing potassium.\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "In dietary supplements, potassium is often present as potassium chloride, but many other forms—including potassium citrate, phosphate, aspartate, bicarbonate, and gluconate—are also used [ 18 ]. The Supplement Facts panel on a dietary supplement label declares the amount of elemental potassium in the product, not the weight of the entire potassium-containing compound. Some dietary supplements contain potassium iodide in microgram amounts, but this ingredient serves as a form of the mineral iodine, not potassium.\nNot all multivitamin/mineral supplements contain potassium, but those that do typically provide about 80 mg potassium [ 18 ]. Potassium-only supplements are also available, and most contain up to 99 mg potassium. Information on many dietary supplements that contain potassium is available in the Dietary Supplement Label Database from the National Institutes of Health, which contains label information from tens of thousands of dietary supplement products on the market.\nMany dietary supplement manufacturers and distributors limit the amount of potassium in their products to 99 mg (which is only about 2% of the DV) because of two concerns related to potassium-containing drugs. First, FDA has ruled that some oral drug products that contain potassium chloride and provide more than 99 mg potassium are not safe because they have been associated with small-bowel lesions [ 19 ]. Second, FDA requires some potassium salts containing more than 99 mg potassium per tablet to be labeled with a warning about the reports of small-bowel lesions [ 20 , 21 ]. In accordance with a ruling by Congress, FDA may not limit the amount of any nutrient, including potassium, in a dietary supplement, except for safety-related reasons [ 22 ]. However, FDA has not issued a ruling about whether dietary supplements containing more than 99 mg potassium must carry a warning label [ 21 , 23 ].\nOnly a few studies have examined how well the various forms of potassium in dietary supplements are absorbed. A 2016 dose-response trial found that humans absorb about 94% of potassium gluconate in supplements, and this absorption rate is similar to that of potassium from potatoes [ 24 ]. According to an older study, liquid forms of potassium chloride (used as drugs to treat conditions such as digitalis intoxication or arrhythmias due to hypokalemia) are absorbed within a few hours [ 6 ]. Enteric coated tablet forms of potassium chloride (designed to prevent dissolution in the stomach but allow it in the small intestine) are not absorbed as rapidly as liquid forms [ 25 ].\n",

    "Bone health": "Observational studies suggest that increased consumption of potassium from fruits and vegetables is associated with increased bone mineral density [ 57 ]. This evidence, combined with evidence from metabolic studies and a few clinical trials, suggests that dietary potassium may improve bone health.\nThe underlying mechanisms are unclear, but one hypothesis is that potassium helps protect bone through its effect on acid-base balance [ 37 ]. Diets that are high in acid-forming foods, such as meats and cereal grains, contribute to metabolic acidosis and might have an adverse effect on bone. Alkaline components in the form of potassium salts (potassium bicarbonate or citrate, but not potassium chloride) from food or potassium supplements might counter this effect and help preserve bone tissue. In the Framingham Heart Study for example, higher potassium intake was associated with significantly greater bone mineral density in 628 elderly men and women [ 58 ]. In another study, the DASH eating pattern significantly reduced biochemical markers of bone turnover [ 59 ]. This eating pattern has a lower acid load than typical Western diets and is also high in calcium and magnesium, in addition to potassium, so any independent contribution of potassium cannot be determined.\nOnly a few clinical trials have examined the effects of potassium supplements on markers of bone health. One trial found that supplementation with potassium citrate at either 60 mmol/day (2,346 mg potassium) or 90 mmol/day (3,519 mg potassium) for 6 months significantly reduced urinary calcium excretion compared with placebo in 52 healthy men and women older than 55 years [ 60 ]. In another clinical trial, 201 healthy adults age 65 years or older received daily supplementation with 60 mEq potassium citrate (providing 2,346 mg potassium) or placebo as well as 500 mg/day calcium (as calcium carbonate) and 400 International Units (IU)/day vitamin D3 for 2 years [ 61 ]. Potassium supplementation significantly increased bone mineral density at the lumbar spine and bone microarchitecture compared with placebo. In a similar clinical trial among older adults, supplemental potassium bicarbonate (mean doses of 2,893 or 4,340 mg/day potassium) for 84 days significantly reduced biochemical markers of bone turnover and urinary calcium excretion [ 62 ]. Conversely, a clinical trial in 276 postmenopausal women age 55–65 years found that supplementation with potassium citrate at either 18.5 mEq/day (providing 723 mg potassium) or 55.5 mEq/day (2,170 mg potassium) for 2 years did not significantly reduce bone turnover or increase bone mineral density at the hip or lumbar spine compared with placebo [ 63 ].\nOverall, higher intakes of potassium from diets that emphasize fruits and vegetables might improve bone health. However, more research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and tease out potassium’s individual contribution.\n",

    "Salt substitutes": "Many salt substitutes contain potassium chloride as a replacement for some or all of the sodium chloride in salt. The potassium content of these products varies widely, from about 440 mg to 2,800 mg potassium per teaspoon [ 1 ]. Some people, such as those with kidney disease or who are taking certain medications, should consult their health care provider before taking salt substitutes because of the risk of hyperkalemia posed by the high levels of potassium in these products.\n",
    "Potassium Intakes and Status": "Dietary surveys consistently show that people in the United States consume less potassium than recommended, which is why the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans identifies potassium as a nutrient of public health concern [ 26 ]. According to data from the 2013–2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the average daily potassium intake from foods is 2,423 mg for males age 2–19, and 1,888 mg for females age 2–19 [ 27 ]. In adults age 20 and over, the average daily potassium intake from foods is 3,016 mg for men and 2,320 mg for women.\nAverage potassium intakes vary by race. Non-Hispanic blacks age 20 and older consume an average of 2,449 mg potassium per day. Average daily intakes are 2,695 mg for Hispanic whites and 2,697 mg for non-Hispanic whites [ 27 ].\nUse of potassium-containing dietary supplements does not significantly increase total potassium intakes among U.S. adults [ 28 ], probably because most potassium-containing dietary supplements provide no more than 99 mg potassium per serving [ 21 ]. Data from NHANES 2013–2014 indicate that 12% of children and adults age 2 and over use supplements containing potassium, and among those who do, supplement use adds a mean of only 87 mg to total daily potassium intakes [ 27 ].\n",
    "Potassium Deficiency": "Insufficient potassium intakes can increase blood pressure, kidney stone risk, bone turnover, urinary calcium excretion, and salt sensitivity (meaning that changes in sodium intakes affect blood pressure to a greater than normal extent) [ 1 ].\nSevere potassium deficiency can cause hypokalemia, (serum potassium level less than about 3.6 mmol/L) [ 3 , 7 , 8 ]. Hypokalemia affects up to 21% of hospitalized patients, usually because of the use of diuretics and other medications [ 29 , 30 ], but it is rare among healthy people with normal kidney function.\nMild hypokalemia is characterized by constipation, fatigue, muscle weakness, and malaise [ 3 ]. Moderate to severe hypokalemia (serum potassium level less than about 2.5 mmol/L) can cause polyuria (large volume of dilute urine); encephalopathy in patients with kidney disease; glucose intolerance; muscular paralysis; poor respiration; and cardiac arrhythmias, especially in individuals with underlying heart disease [ 1 , 3 , 7 ]. Severe hypokalemia can be life threatening because of its effects on muscle contraction and, hence, cardiac function [ 5 ].\nHypokalemia is rarely caused by low dietary potassium intake alone, but it can result from diarrhea due to potassium losses in the stool. It can also result from vomiting, which produces metabolic alkalosis, leading to potassium losses in the kidneys. Hypokalemia can also be caused by refeeding syndrome (the metabolic response to initial refeeding after a starvation period) because of potassium’s movement into cells, laxative abuse, diuretic use, eating clay (a type of pica), heavy sweating, or dialysis [ 3 , 5 , 7 , 31 , 32 ].\nMagnesium depletion can contribute to hypokalemia by increasing urinary potassium losses [ 1 , 33 , 34 ]. It can also increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias by decreasing intracellular potassium concentrations. More than 50% of individuals with clinically significant hypokalemia might have magnesium deficiency [ 34 ]. In people with hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia, both should be treated concurrently [ 7 ].\n",
    "Groups at Risk of Potassium Inadequacy": "Potassium inadequacy can occur with intakes that are below the AI but above the amount required to prevent hypokalemia. The following groups are more likely than others to have poor potassium status.\n",
    "People with inflammatory bowel diseases": "Potassium is secreted within the colon, and this process is normally balanced by absorption [ 35 ]. However, in inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis), potassium secretion increases, which can lead to poor potassium status. Inflammatory bowel diseases are also characterized by chronic diarrhea, which can further increase potassium excretion [ 36 ].\n",
    "People who use certain medications, including diuretics and laxatives": "Certain diuretics (e.g., thiazide diuretics) that are commonly used to treat high blood pressure increase urinary potassium excretion and can cause hypokalemia [ 7 , 8 ]. Potassium-sparing diuretics, however, do not increase potassium excretion and can actually cause hyperkalemia. Large doses of laxatives and repeated use of enemas can also cause hypokalemia because they increase losses of potassium in stool.\n",
    "People with pica": "Pica is the persistent eating of non-nutritive substances, such as clay. When consumed, clay binds potassium in the gastrointestinal tract, which can increase potassium excretion and lead to hypokalemia [ 5 , 31 , 32 ]. Cessation of pica combined with potassium supplementation can restore potassium status and resolve symptoms of potassium deficiency.\n",
    "Potassium and Health": "Because of potassium’s wide-ranging roles in the body, low intakes can increase the risk of illness. This section focuses on four diseases and disorders in which potassium might be involved: hypertension and stroke, kidney stones, bone health, and blood glucose control and type 2 diabetes.\n",
    "Hypertension and stroke": "Hypertension, a major risk factor for coronary heart disease and stroke, affects almost a third of Americans [ 2 , 37 ]. According to an extensive body of literature, low potassium intakes increase the risk of hypertension, especially when combined with high sodium intakes [ 16 , 38-40 ]. Higher potassium intakes, in contrast, may help decrease blood pressure, in part by increasing vasodilation and urinary sodium excretion, which in turn reduces plasma volume [ 1 ]; this effect may be most pronounced in salt-sensitive individuals [ 2 , 3 , 5 , 37 , 41 ].\nThe Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating pattern, which emphasizes potassium from fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products, lowers systolic blood pressure by an average of 5.5 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 3.0 mmHg [ 42 ]. The DASH eating pattern provides three times more potassium than the average American diet. However, it also increases intakes of other nutrients, such as magnesium and calcium, that are also associated with reductions in blood pressure, so potassium’s independent contribution cannot be determined. Additional information and sample DASH menu plans are available on the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute website.\nResults from most clinical trials suggest that potassium supplementation reduces blood pressure. A 2017 meta-analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials in 1,163 participants with hypertension found significant reductions in systolic blood pressure (by 4.48 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (by 2.96 mmHg) with potassium supplementation, mostly as potassium chloride at 30–120 mmol/day potassium (1,173–4,692 mg), for 4–15 weeks [ 43 ]. Another meta-analysis of 15 randomized controlled trials found that potassium supplements (mostly containing potassium chloride at 60–65 mEq/day potassium [2,346–2,541 mg]) for 4–24 weeks in 917 patients with normal blood pressure or hypertension who were not taking antihypertensive medications significantly reduced both systolic and diastolic blood pressure [ 44 ]. The supplements had the greatest effect in patients with hypertension, reducing systolic blood pressure by a mean of 6.8 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 4.6 mmHg. Two earlier meta-analyses of 19 trials [ 45 ] and 33 trials [ 46 ] had similar findings. However, a Cochrane Review of six of the highest-quality trials found nonsignificant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure with potassium supplementation [ 47 ].\nIn 2018, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) published a systematic review of the effects of sodium and potassium intakes on chronic disease outcomes and their risk factors [ 48 ]. The authors concluded that, based on observational studies, the associations between dietary potassium intakes and lower blood pressure in adults were inconsistent. They also found no evidence for an association between potassium intakes and the risk of hypertension. The authors did report, however, that potassium supplements (mostly containing potassium chloride) in doses ranging from 20 to 120 mmol/day (782 to 4,692 mg/day) for 1 to 36 months lowered both systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to placebo. A similar analysis conducted by the NASEM committee that included 16 trials found that potassium supplements significantly lowered systolic blood pressure by a mean of 6.87 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 3.57 mmHg [ 11 ]. However, the effects were stronger among studies including participants with hypertension; for studies including only participants without hypertension, the effects were not statistically significant. Based on 13 randomized controlled trials that primarily enrolled patients with hypertension, the AHRQ review found that the use of potassium-containing salt substitutes in place of sodium chloride significantly reduced systolic blood pressure in adults by a mean of 5.58 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 2.88 mmHg [ 48 ]. However, reducing sodium intake decreased both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in adults, and increasing potassium intake via food or supplements did not reduce blood pressure any further. This finding suggests that at least some of the beneficial effects of potassium salt substitutes on blood pressure may be due to the accompanying reduction in sodium intake, rather than the increase in potassium intake.\nHigher potassium intakes have been associated with a decreased risk of stroke and possibly other cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) [ 16 , 49 ]. A meta-analysis of 11 prospective cohort studies in 247,510 adults found that a 1,640 mg per day higher potassium intake was associated with a significant 21% lower risk of stroke as well as nonsignificant lower risks of coronary heart disease and total CVD [ 39 ]. Similarly, the authors of a meta-analysis of nine cohort studies reported a significant 24% lower risk of stroke with higher potassium intakes and a nonsignificant reduction in coronary heart disease and CVD risk [ 50 ]. However, the AHRQ review found inconsistent relationships between potassium intakes and risk of stroke based on 15 observational studies [ 48 ].\nAny beneficial effect of potassium on CVD is likely due to its antihypertensive effects. However, some research shows a benefit even when blood pressure is accounted for. For example, a 2016 meta-analysis of 16 cohort studies with a total of 639,440 participants found that those with the highest potassium intakes (median 103 mmol [4,027 mg] per day) had a 15% lower risk of stroke than those with the lowest potassium intakes (median 52.5 mmol [2,053 mg] per day). In addition, participants who consumed 90 mmol potassium/day (approximately 3,500 mg) had the lowest risk of stroke [ 51 ]. However, even when blood pressure was accounted for, higher potassium intakes still produced a significant 13% lower risk of stroke. These findings suggest that other mechanisms (e.g., improved endothelial function and reduced free radical formation) may be involved [ 37 ].\nFDA has approved the following health claim: \"Diets containing foods that are a good source of potassium and that are low in sodium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure and stroke\" [ 17 ]. Overall, the evidence suggests that consuming more potassium might have a favorable effect on blood pressure and stroke, and it might also help prevent other forms of CVD. However, more research on both dietary and supplemental potassium is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.\n",
    "Kidney stones": "Kidney stones are most common in people age 40 to 60 [ 52 ]. Stones containing calcium—in the form of calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate—are the most common type of kidney stone. Low potassium intakes impair calcium reabsorption within the kidney, increasing urinary calcium excretion and potentially causing hypercalciuria and kidney stones [ 16 , 37 ]. Low urinary levels of citrate also contribute to kidney stone development.\nObservational studies show inverse associations between dietary potassium intakes and risk of kidney stones. In a cohort of 45,619 men age 40 to 75 years with no history of kidney stones, those with the highest potassium intakes (≥4,042 mg/day on average) had a 51% lower risk of kidney stones over 4 years of follow-up than those with the lowest intakes (≤2,895 mg/day) [ 53 ]. Similarly, in more than 90,000 women age 34–59 who participated in the Nurses' Health Study and had no history of kidney stones, those who consumed an average of more than 4,099 mg of potassium per day had a 35% lower risk of kidney stones over a 12-year follow-up period than those who averaged less than 2,407 mg of potassium per day [ 54 ].\nSome research suggests that supplementation with potassium citrate reduces hypercalciuria as well as the risk of kidney stone formation and growth [ 52 , 55 ]. In a clinical trial of 57 patients with at least two kidney stones (either calcium oxalate or calcium oxalate plus calcium phosphate) over the previous 2 years and hypocitraturia (low urinary citrate levels), supplementation with 30–60 mEq potassium citrate (providing 1,173 to 2,346 mg potassium) for 3 years significantly reduced kidney stone formation compared with placebo [ 55 ]. This study was included in a 2015 Cochrane Review of seven studies that examined the effects of potassium citrate, potassium-sodium citrate, and potassium-magnesium citrate supplementation on the prevention and treatment of calcium-containing kidney stones in a total of 477 participants, most of whom had calcium oxalate stones [ 52 ]. The potassium citrate salts significantly reduced the risk of new stones and reduced stone size. However, the proposed mechanism involves citrate, not potassium per se; citrate forms complexes with urinary calcium and increases urine pH, inhibiting the formation of calcium oxalate crystals [ 52 , 56 ]. The authors of the AHRQ review [ 48 ] concluded that observational studies suggest an association between higher potassium intakes and lower risk of kidney stones. However, they also found the evidence insufficient to determine whether potassium supplements are effective because only one trial that addressed this question [ 55 ] met their inclusion criteria.\nAdditional research is needed to fully understand the potential link between dietary and supplemental potassium and the risk of kidney stones.\n",
    "Blood glucose control and type 2 diabetes": "Type 2 diabetes is a growing public health concern that currently affects almost 12% of U.S. adults [ 64 ]. Although individuals with obesity have an elevated risk of type 2 diabetes, other metabolic factors also play a role. Because potassium is needed for insulin secretion from pancreatic cells, hypokalemia impairs insulin secretion and could lead to glucose intolerance [ 2 ]. This effect has been observed mainly with long-term use of diuretics (particularly those containing thiazides) or hyperaldosteronism (excessive aldosterone production), which both increase urinary potassium losses, but it can occur in healthy individuals as well [ 2 , 10 , 16 , 65 ].\nNumerous observational studies of adults have found associations between lower potassium intakes or lower serum or urinary potassium levels and increased rates of fasting glucose, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes [ 66-72 ]. These associations might be stronger in African Americans, who tend to have lower potassium intakes, than in whites [ 68 , 71 ]. For example, one study of 1,066 adults age 18–30 years without diabetes found that those with urinary potassium levels in the lowest quintile were more than twice as likely to develop type 2 diabetes over 15 years of follow-up than those in the highest quintile [ 68 ]. Among 4,754 participants from the same study with potassium intake data, African Americans with lower potassium intakes had a significantly greater risk of type 2 diabetes over 20 years of follow-up than those with higher intakes, but this association was not found in whites.\nIn another observational study, which analyzed data from 84,360 women age 34–59 years participating in the Nurses’ Health Study, those in the highest quintile of potassium intake had a 38% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes over 6 years of follow-up than those in the lowest quintile [ 66 ]. Serum potassium levels were inversely associated with fasting glucose levels in 5,415 participants age 45–84 years from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, but these levels had no significant association with diabetes risk over 8 years of follow-up [ 70 ].\nAlthough observational studies suggest that potassium status is linked to blood glucose control and type 2 diabetes, this association has not been adequately evaluated in clinical trials. In a small clinical trial in 29 African American adults with prediabetes and low to normal serum potassium levels (3.3–4.0 mmol/L), supplementation with 40 mEq (1,564 mg) potassium (as potassium chloride) for 3 months significantly lowered fasting glucose levels, but it did not affect glucose or insulin measures during an oral glucose tolerance test [ 73 ].\nThe findings from studies conducted to date are promising. However, more research, including randomized controlled trials, is needed before potassium’s link with blood glucose control and type 2 diabetes can be confirmed.\n",
    "Dietary potassium": "In healthy people with normal kidney function, high dietary potassium intakes do not pose a health risk because the kidneys eliminate excess amounts in the urine [ 1 ]. Although case reports indicate that very large doses of potassium supplements can cause heart abnormalities and death, the NASEM committee concluded that these reports do not provide sufficient evidence to set a UL [ 11 ]. In addition, there is no evidence that high intakes of potassium cause hyperkalemia in adults with normal kidney function or other adverse effects. Therefore, the committee did not set a UL for potassium.\nHowever, in people with impaired urinary potassium excretion due to chronic kidney disease or the use of certain medications, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or potassium-sparing diuretics, even dietary potassium intakes below the AI can cause hyperkalemia [ 11 ]. Hyperkalemia can also occur in people with type 1 diabetes, congestive heart failure, adrenal insufficiency, or liver disease [ 7 ]. Individuals at risk of hyperkalemia should consult a physician or registered dietitian about appropriate potassium intakes from all sources. Information on low-potassium diets is also available from the National Kidney Disease Education Program.\nAlthough hyperkalemia can be asymptomatic, severe cases can cause muscle weakness, paralysis, heart palpitations, paresthesias (a burning or prickling sensation in the extremities), and cardiac arrhythmias that could be life threatening [ 1 , 7 ].\n",
    "Potassium from dietary supplements, salt substitutes, and medications": "Potassium supplements can cause minor gastrointestinal side effects [ 48 ]. Chronic ingestion of doses of potassium supplements (e.g., up to 15,600 mg for 5 days) in healthy people can increase plasma levels of potassium, but not beyond the normal range [ 1 ]. However, very high amounts of potassium supplements or salt substitutes that contain potassium could exceed the kidney’s capacity to excrete potassium, causing acute hyperkalemia even in healthy individuals.\nThe use of potassium salts in certain medications has been associated with small-bowel lesions, causing obstruction, hemorrhage, and perforation [ 20 , 74 ]. For this reason, FDA requires some oral drugs providing more than 99 mg of potassium to be labeled with a warning.\n",
    "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers": "ACE inhibitors, such as benazepril (Lotensin), and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) such as losartan (Cozaar), are used to treat hypertension and heart failure, slow progression of kidney disease in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, and decrease morbidity and mortality after myocardial infarction [ 75-77 ]. These medications reduce urinary potassium excretion, which can lead to hyperkalemia. Experts recommend monitoring potassium status in people taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs, especially if they have other risk factors for hyperkalemia, such as impaired kidney function [ 75 ].\n",
    "Loop and thiazide diuretics": "Treatment with loop diuretics, such as furosemide (Lasix) and bumetanide (Bumex), and thiazide diuretics, such as chlorothiazide (Diuril) and metolazone (Zaroxolyn), increases urinary potassium excretion and can lead to hypokalemia [ 77 , 78 ]. Experts recommend monitoring potassium status in people taking these medications and initiating potassium supplementation if warranted [ 77 ].\n",
    "Potassium and Healthful Diets": "The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils.

    "Iron": "Iron is a component of hemoglobin and myoglobin and is one of the most critical micronutrients during pregnancy for both maternal and fetal health. The RDA for iron increases during pregnancy to 27 mg. Most pregnant women in the United States (83.8%) have dietary iron intakes that are below the EAR. Dietary supplements that contain iron can help increase intakes to the recommended amounts and may be particularly useful for people who follow a vegetarian or vegan diet. Dietary supplements that contain iron decrease the risk of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy and are recommended by many experts. However, routine iron supplementation in iron-replete pregnant women may have adverse health effects. The iron UL during pregnancy is 45 mg/day, and about one-fourth of pregnant women in the United States (27.9%) exceed the UL when iron intakes from food and supplements are combined.\nIron is a mineral that is an essential component of hemoglobin and myoglobin, both of which are critical for oxygen transfer in the body [ 130 , 131 ]. Iron is important for muscle metabolism, healthy connective tissue, physical growth, neurological development, cellular functioning, and hormone synthesis [ 131 , 132 ].\nThe RDA for iron during pregnancy is 27 mg [ 8 ]. This value is higher than the RDA of 15 mg for nonpregnant women age 14 to 18 years and 18 mg for nonpregnant women age 19 to 50 years.\nDietary iron has two forms: heme iron and nonheme iron, which has a lower bioavailability [ 130 ]. Dietary sources of heme iron include animal proteins, such as lean meat and seafood [ 17 ]. Good sources of nonheme iron include nuts; beans; vegetables, such as spinach; and fortified grain products. Vitamin C enhances the absorption of nonheme iron, whereas calcium can interfere with the absorption of iron [ 8 , 133 ]. For this reason, some experts recommend taking stand-alone calcium and iron supplements at different times of the day [ 134 ].\nIron is available in many dietary supplements [ 12 ]. This includes most prenatal supplements; according to a 2021 evaluation of 188 prenatal supplements on the U.S. market, 89% of these products included iron, with a median amount of 27 mg/serving [ 30 ]. Another evaluation of 214 products found that nonprescription prenatal supplements contained a mean of 27 mg of iron, while prescription products contained a mean of 28 mg [ 11 ]. Gummy formulations often contain no iron [ 25 ].\nMost pregnant women in the United States do not obtain sufficient amounts of iron from their diet. An analysis of 2001–2014 NHANES data found that pregnant women age 20 to 40 years had a mean daily intake of 17.2 mg of iron from foods, and 83.8% of them were consuming less than the EAR for iron [ 18 ]. Dietary supplements that contain iron can help pregnant women reach the recommended intake of iron during pregnancy, especially those who follow a vegetarian or vegan diet [ 17 ]. When total intakes, including dietary supplements, are considered, the mean daily iron intake among pregnant women in the United States increases to 38.3 mg, and the percentage of women who do not meet the EAR decreases to 36.2% [ 18 ].\nSome women in the United States who are pregnant might obtain too much iron. The UL for iron during pregnancy is 45 mg/day for ages 14 years and older, which is the same as that for nonpregnant women in the same age range [ 8 ]. When total iron intakes from foods and dietary supplements are considered, 27.9% of pregnant women age 20 to 40 years in the United States exceed the UL according to 2001–2014 NHANES data [ 18 ].\nObtaining the recommended amount of iron during pregnancy is critical for maternal health and proper fetal development. It is estimated that 10% to 16% of women in the United States have iron deficiency during pregnancy, and the prevalence is higher—about 25%—during the third trimester [ 17 , 135 ].\nIron deficiency during pregnancy increases the risk of anemia, maternal and infant mortality, preterm birth, low birthweight, and impaired cognitive and behavioral development [ 86 , 136 ]. WHO guidelines define iron deficiency during pregnancy as ferritin concentrations that are less than 15 mcg/L in the first trimester in otherwise healthy women and anemia as hemoglobin concentrations that are less than 10.5 to 11 g/dL, depending on trimester [ 137 , 138 ]. It is important to note, however, that ferritin is not a sensitive marker of iron deficiency because acute and chronic inflammation can increase ferritin concentrations [ 139 ]. Similarly, hemoglobin is not a sensitive nor specific measure of iron deficiency. Hemoglobin concentrations can be interpreted in conjunction with ferritin measurements to help identify iron deficiency anemia (IDA) [ 135 ].\nRCTs have shown that iron supplementation can prevent IDA in pregnant women and some of the related adverse consequences in their infants [ 140-143 ]. In some of these studies, iron supplementation was combined with folic acid or other vitamins and minerals.\nA 2024 Cochrane Review included 40 trials that examined the effects of stand-alone daily iron supplements during pregnancy [ 143 ]. The trials were conducted in many countries, including 27 trials conducted in Europe, 8 in the United States, 5 in Africa, and 3 in China. The doses of iron supplements that were used in the trials varied widely, but the most commonly used doses were 60 mg (17 trials) and 30 mg (6 trials). The authors found the following:\nIron supplementation reduced the risk of maternal IDA at term by 59% based on a moderate certainty of evidence. Iron supplementation reduced the risk of maternal anemia by 70% and maternal iron deficiency at term by 49%, although these findings were based on a low certainty of evidence. Iron supplementation reduced the risk of low birthweight by 16% based on a moderate certainty of evidence. Iron supplementation did not significantly affect infant birthweight or the risk of preterm birth, neonatal death, or congenital anomalies (e.g., NTDs) based on a very low to moderate certainty of evidence.\nAlthough iron supplementation in pregnant women with iron deficiency has proven benefits, the benefits and harms of routine iron supplementation during pregnancy in iron-replete women are uncertain [ 144 , 145 ]. For example, some studies have linked iron supplementation or high iron status in iron-replete pregnant women with an increased risk of gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and impaired fetal growth [ 145 ].\nThese findings suggest a U-shaped risk of adverse health effects with both iron deficiency and iron excess. They are also reflected in the different recommendations from expert groups for iron supplementation during pregnancy.\nThe recommendations from professional societies, government agencies, and public health organizations for iron supplementation during pregnancy are summarized in Table 7.\nMore information is available in the ODS fact sheet on iron for health professionals .\n",

    "Nutrient Intake Recommendations and Upper Limits": "Intake recommendations for all essential nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [ 1 ]. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals. Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA. Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals. Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects.\nTable 1 lists the current micronutrient RDAs and AIs during pregnancy [ 2-8 ]. If an entry is bolded , it means that the intake recommendation for that nutrient is higher during pregnancy. If an entry is not bolded, the intake recommendations are the same for pregnant and nonpregnant females of the same age.\nMost nutrients have ULs that are based on levels of intake that may cause adverse health effects. Other nutrients do not have ULs due to a lack of data showing adverse effects at high intakes.\nFor folate, magnesium, niacin, and vitamin E, the ULs apply only to supplemental intakes (e.g., dietary supplements, fortified foods, medications), not dietary intakes of the nutrient naturally present in food [ 5-7 ]. For vitamin A, the UL applies only to preformed vitamin A, not beta-carotene or other provitamin A carotenoids. In all other cases, the ULs apply to total intakes, including dietary and supplemental intakes [ 8 ].\nFor omega-3 fatty acids, the FNB established an Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range for alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) of 0.6% to 1.2% of energy for anyone age 1 year and older [ 2 ].\nTable 2 lists the current ULs during pregnancy [ 2-8 ]. The bolded entry for phosphorus indicates that this nutrient has a lower UL for females who are pregnant (3,500 mg) than for those who are not (4,000 mg). For all other nutrients, the ULs are the same for pregnant and nonpregnant females of the same age.\n",
    "Prenatal Supplements": "As shown in Table 1, many nutritional requirements are increased during pregnancy. Consuming a variety of nutritious foods can help pregnant women obtain the nutrients needed for a healthy pregnancy.\nDietary supplements, including prenatal multivitamin/mineral supplements, can also help ensure sufficient nutrient intakes for a healthy pregnancy [ 9-13 ]. These products are hereafter referred to as “prenatal supplements.”\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends screening patients regarding their diet and supplement use to ensure they are meeting recommended intakes for calcium, iron, vitamin A, the B vitamins, vitamin D, and other nutrients [ 14 ]. ACOG and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics also recommend that pregnant women take a daily prenatal supplement [ 15 , 16 ]. The 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) notes that most health care providers recommend a daily prenatal supplement for women who are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant in addition to following a healthy dietary pattern [ 17 ]. The DGA adds that prenatal supplements may be especially important to meet folate/folic acid, iron, iodine, and vitamin D needs during pregnancy.\nAn analysis of data from the 2001–2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) indicates that about 70% of pregnant women in the United States take a dietary supplement [ 18 ]. However, even after accounting for dietary supplement use, many pregnant women in the United States have inadequate intakes of some micronutrients [ 18 , 19 ]. According to an analysis of data from the U.S. Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) consortium, pregnant women who are of Hispanic ethnicity or non-White race, have less than a high school education, are age 14 to 18 years, or have obesity are at higher risk than others of inadequate micronutrient intakes [ 19 ].\nPrenatal supplements are available over the counter, or they can be prescribed by a health care provider, which makes them eligible for health insurance reimbursement [ 20 ]. However, no standard or federal statutory definition exists for prescription or nonprescription prenatal supplements in terms of the ingredients and doses they should contain [ 10 , 21 ]. Product formulations vary considerably, so it is important to consider both the ingredients and the doses in these products. For example, some prenatal supplements do not contain iodine [ 22 ], while others do not contain choline [ 23 , 24 ]. In other cases, the doses that are present in the product are lower than recommended amounts. For example, choline is often present in relatively small amounts in prenatal supplements [ 23 ]. Some prenatal supplements may not provide folate in the recommended form of folic acid for reducing the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs) [ 20 ]. Gummy formulations often contain no iron or calcium [ 25 ]. In addition, some prenatal supplements contain botanical and other ingredients, such as probiotics [ 11 , 12 ]. Many of these ingredients have not been thoroughly studied in pregnant women.\nThere are also formulation differences between prescription and nonprescription prenatal supplements. A 2017 evaluation of prenatal supplement labels in the United States found that prescription products contained a mean of 9 vitamins and 4 minerals, whereas nonprescription products contained a mean of 11 vitamins and 8 minerals [ 11 ]. In addition, prescription products had higher labeled amounts of folic acid compared with nonprescription products, whereas nonprescription products had higher labeled amounts of iodine, calcium, vitamin A, and vitamin D.\nA 2023 analysis examined more than 20,000 dietary supplements on the U.S. market, including 421 prenatal supplements, to determine how labeled doses of six key nutrients during pregnancy (vitamin A, vitamin D, folate, calcium, iron, and long-chain omega-3 fatty acids) compare with “target doses” [ 26 ]. Target doses were derived by determining usual nutrient intakes via 24-hour dietary recalls and calculating optimal supplementation doses to shift 90% of participants to intakes above the EARs while keeping 90% of participants below the ULs. Out of the 69 products that contained all six nutrients, only one product, which was not a prenatal supplement, contained the target doses for those nutrients.\nClinicians should also be aware that the actual doses in prenatal products may differ from label values. A 2023 report from the U.S. Government Accounting Office that examined 12 over-the-counter prenatal supplement products found that 11 of the 12 products contained at least one nutrient with an amount outside acceptable deviations from the label value, based on U.S. Pharmacopeia thresholds [ 21 ]. There were also trace amounts of lead or cadmium in 6 of the 12 prenatal supplements tested, although not in amounts likely to cause a health concern based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) metrics.\nIn addition, an analysis of 51 samples from 26 prenatal supplements that are commonly used in Canada, including one prescription brand, found that 14 samples contained doses of lead that exceeded the limit set by California Proposition 65 and the U.S. Pharmacopeia (>0.5 mcg/day) [ 27 ]. Three samples also exceeded known upper limits for aluminum and inorganic arsenic.\nChoosing a product that has been tested by an independent quality assurance organization can help ensure that it was properly manufactured, contains the ingredients and doses listed on the label, and does not contain harmful levels of contaminants. Consumerlab.com, NSF, and U.S. Pharmacopeia are independent organizations that offer dietary supplement quality testing [ 10 ].\n",
    "Key Nutrient Considerations Before and During Pregnancy": "Obtaining the recommended amounts of all nutrients is important for a healthy pregnancy. Certain nutrients have critical roles before and during pregnancy and may be underconsumed among pregnant women. These include calcium, choline, folate/folic acid, iodine, iron, magnesium, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin A, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin D, and zinc. It is also important to note that excessive intakes of preformed vitamin A (but not beta-carotene or other provitamin A carotenoids) can be teratogenic [ 8 ].\nThe sections below provide a brief overview of each of these key nutrients; the recommended amounts and ULs during pregnancy; food and supplement sources; a summary of the research on dietary supplements and pregnancy; and, where available, clinical practice guidelines from professional societies, government agencies, and public health organizations. Nutrients are presented in alphabetical order.\n",
    "Calcium": "Calcium is an important nutrient during pregnancy because of its role in building and maintaining strong bones and teeth. The RDA for calcium during pregnancy is 1,300 mg for ages 14 to 18 years and 1,000 mg for ages 19 to 50 years. About one-fifth (21.2%) of pregnant women in the United States have dietary calcium intakes that are below the EAR. Dietary supplements that contain calcium can help increase intakes to recommended amounts and may be particularly useful for people who do not consume dairy products or calcium-fortified milk substitutes. Prenatal supplements, however, typically contain relatively low amounts of calcium. Calcium supplementation of 1,500 to 2,000 mg/day may reduce the risk of preeclampsia in pregnant women who obtain insufficient amounts of calcium from their diet. The calcium UL during pregnancy is 3,000 mg/day for ages 14 to 18 years and 2,500 mg/day for ages 19 to 50 years.\nCalcium, the most abundant mineral in the body, comprises much of the structure of bones and teeth. It also mediates blood vessel contraction and dilation, muscle function, blood clotting, nerve transmission, and hormonal secretion [ 4 , 28 ]. Vitamin D promotes calcium absorption.\nThe RDA for calcium during pregnancy is 1,300 mg for ages 14 to 18 years and 1,000 mg for ages 19 to 50 years [ 4 ]. These values are the same as those for nonpregnant females in the same age ranges.\nGood food sources of calcium include milk, yogurt, and cheese. Calcium is also present in some nondairy foods [ 4 ]. For example, certain vegetables such as kale, broccoli, and Chinese cabbage (bok choi) provide some calcium. In addition, some fruit juices and plant-based milk substitutes are fortified with calcium. However, the bioavailability of calcium from some plant-based foods is lower than that from milk products [ 29 ].\nCalcium is available in many dietary supplements, including some prenatal supplements [ 12 ]. According to a 2021 evaluation of 188 prenatal supplements on the U.S. market, 78% of these products included calcium, with a median amount of 200 mg/serving [ 30 ]. Another evaluation of 214 products found that nonprescription prenatal supplements contained a mean of 368 mg of calcium, while prescription products contained a mean of 172 mg [ 11 ]. Gummy formulations often contain no calcium [ 25 ].\nAccording to the 2020–2025 DGA, calcium is a nutrient of public health concern because it is underconsumed by the U.S. population [ 17 ]. Similarly, some pregnant women in the United States do not obtain sufficient amounts of calcium. An analysis of 2001–2014 NHANES data found that pregnant women age 20 to 40 years had a mean daily intake of calcium from foods of 1,093 mg, and 21.2% of them were consuming less than the EAR for calcium [ 18 ].\nDietary supplements that contain calcium can help pregnant women reach the recommended intake of calcium. These supplements may be particularly useful for women who do not regularly eat dairy products or calcium-fortified foods. This could include those who are lactose intolerant, have a milk allergy, or who follow a vegan diet [ 31 ]. However, as noted above, prenatal supplements typically contain relatively low amounts of calcium [ 11 , 30 ].\nWhen total intakes, including dietary supplements, are considered, the mean daily calcium intake among pregnant women in the United States increases to 1,311 mg, and the percentage of women who fall below the EAR decreases to 12.9% [ 18 ]. Pregnant women who are age 14 to 18 years, races or ethnicities other than non-Hispanic White, or those who have less than a high school education may be more likely than others to have total calcium intakes from food and dietary supplements that are below the EAR, according to data from the ECHO consortium [ 19 ].\nA small percentage of pregnant women in the United States might obtain too much calcium. The UL for calcium during pregnancy is 3,000 mg/day for ages 14 to 18 years and 2,500 mg for ages 19 to 50 years [ 4 ]. These values are the same as those for nonpregnant females. When total calcium intakes from foods and dietary supplements are considered, 3% of pregnant women age 20 to 40 years in the United States exceed the calcium UL according to 2001–2014 NHANES data [ 18 ].\nObtaining the recommended amount of calcium during pregnancy is important for both fetal and maternal health because calcium is important for building and maintaining strong bones and teeth [ 4 , 32 ].\nIn addition, calcium supplementation during pregnancy might reduce the risk of gestational hypertension. It may also reduce the risk of preeclampsia, a serious condition characterized by hypertension and proteinuria that usually occurs after 20 weeks gestation [ 33 , 34 ]. However, research indicates that the benefit of calcium supplementation for reducing the risk of preeclampsia applies only to pregnant women with inadequate calcium intakes (such as those with intakes below 600 mg/day), so calcium supplementation for this purpose is usually recommended only in populations with low calcium intakes, such as those in many low- and middle-income countries. In addition, much of the evidence for calcium and preeclampsia comes from studies with methodological weaknesses [ 35 , 36 ].\nA 2024 meta-analysis included 26 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in 20,038 women that evaluated calcium supplementation during pregnancy [ 37 ]. In most of the RCTs, calcium supplementation was started before 24 weeks gestation. The analysis found the following:\nCalcium supplementation reduced the risk of preeclampsia by 49% and the risk of gestational hypertension by 30%. Calcium supplementation did not significantly affect other outcomes, including the risk of preterm delivery, small for gestational age, low birth weight, or perinatal or maternal mortality.\nA 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis that included 30 trials in 20,445 women examined the effects of both high-dose (at least 1,000 mg/day) and low-dose (less than 1,000 mg/day) calcium supplementation on the risk of preeclampsia, [ 38 ]. About half of the trials were conducted in countries in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific and Eastern Mediterranean regions. It found the following:\nOverall, both high-dose and low-dose calcium supplementation reduced the risk of preeclampsia by 51%. The effects of calcium supplementation did not differ based on baseline preeclampsia risk, vitamin D supplementation, or the time that calcium supplementation was initiated. Calcium supplementation did not affect preeclampsia risk in women with adequate baseline calcium intake (adequate intake not defined). Based on these findings, the authors concluded that low-dose calcium supplementation is as effective as high-dose supplementation. They also concluded that calcium supplementation should be recommended only for women with low calcium intake.\nA 2018 Cochrane Review included 27 RCTs that evaluated the use of calcium supplements during pregnancy to prevent hypertensive disorders and related problems [ 39 ]. The RCTs were conducted in many different countries including Ecuador, India, Iran, and the United States. Thirteen trials in 15,730 women—none of which administered vitamin D supplements—evaluated high-dose calcium (at least 1,000 mg/day). Twelve trials in 2,334 women evaluated calcium doses that were less than 1,000 mg/day (usually 500 mg/day) either alone, or combined with vitamin D, linoleic acid, or antioxidants. The review found the following:\nHigh-dose calcium supplementation reduced the risk of high blood pressure by 35%. It also reduced the risk of preeclampsia by 55%, but subgroup analyses showed that the risk of preeclampsia was reduced only in those with low dietary calcium intakes (usually defined as less than 900 mg/day), not in those with adequate intakes. In addition, the quality of this evidence was low. Calcium supplementation of less than 1,000 mg/day reduced the risk of high blood pressure by 47% and preeclampsia by 62%. However, most of these trials recruited women who were at high risk of preeclampsia, and the trials had a high risk of bias.\nLimited research has examined whether calcium supplementation during pregnancy helps prevent leg cramps. A Cochrane Review analyzed two studies that compared the use of calcium supplements to no intervention and one study that compared the use of calcium supplements to vitamin C [ 40 ]. Fewer women in the calcium groups had leg cramps than in the no intervention groups. However, there were no differences between groups for the composite outcome of leg cramp intensity and frequency. There was no difference in leg cramp frequency between women who took calcium and those who took vitamin C. The authors concluded that it is unclear whether calcium supplements reduce the incidence of leg cramps during pregnancy.\nSeveral professional societies and public health organizations recommend calcium supplements for pregnant women with low calcium intakes to reduce the risk of preeclampsia. These recommendations are summarized in Table 3.\nMore information is available in the ODS calcium fact sheet for health professionals .\n",
    "Choline": "Choline is an important nutrient for fetal growth and central nervous system development. The AI for choline increases during pregnancy to 450 mg. Most pregnant women in the United States do not consume the recommended amount of choline. Some evidence suggests that low choline intake during pregnancy may increase the risk of neural tube defects. Dietary supplements that contain choline can help increase intakes to recommended amounts. However, less than half of the prenatal supplements on the U.S. market contain choline, and those that do often provide only small amounts. The UL for choline during pregnancy is 3,000 mg/day for ages 14 to 18 years and 3,500 mg/day for ages 19 to 50 years.\nCholine is an essential nutrient that is required for the synthesis of phosphatidyl choline and sphingomyelin, two major phospholipids that are vital for cell membranes. All plant and animal cells need choline to preserve their structural integrity [ 6 , 45 ]. Choline also plays a role in cell membrane signaling, neurotransmitter production, nervous system function and early brain development, gene expression, and lipid transport and metabolism [ 6 , 45 , 46 ].\nThe AI for choline during pregnancy is 450 mg [ 6 ]. This value is higher than the AI for nonpregnant females, which is 400 mg for ages 14 to 18 years and 425 mg for ages 19 and older.\nThe main dietary sources of choline in the United States are animal-based products, including meat, poultry, fish, dairy products, and eggs. Other sources of choline include cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli and brussels sprouts; soybeans; nuts; seeds; and whole grains [ 47-51 ].\nCholine is available in many dietary supplements, but not all prenatal supplements contain choline [ 12 ]. A 2022 evaluation of 188 prenatal supplements on the U.S. market found that 40% of these products included choline, with a median amount of only 25 mg/serving [ 23 ].\nMost pregnant women in the United States do not meet the recommended intakes of choline [ 17 ]. An analysis of 2001–2014 NHANES data found that pregnant women age 20 to 40 years had a mean daily intake of choline from foods of 321 mg, and only 7.7% of them had an intake above the AI for choline [ 18 ]. Contributions from dietary supplements do not add substantially to total choline intakes during pregnancy. Given the low amounts of choline in most prenatal supplements, total intakes from foods and dietary supplements among pregnant women in the United States are similar to that from food alone [ 18 ].\nThe risk of inadequate choline status in pregnant women might be greater in those who do not take folic acid supplements, those with low vitamin B12 status, and those with a genetic variant in the folate-metabolizing enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase [ 24 , 52 ]. Dietary supplements that contain choline can help pregnant women reach the recommended intake of choline and they may be particularly useful for people who follow a vegan diet or avoid eggs. However, as noted above, prenatal supplements typically contain only small amounts of choline [ 23 ], so it is important to check product labels to determine whether choline is present and what amount the product contains.\nThe UL for choline during pregnancy is 3,000 mg/day for ages 14 to 18 years and 3,500 mg for ages 19 to 50 years [ 6 ]. These values are the same as those for nonpregnant females. Limited data suggest that no pregnant women exceed the UL for choline when total intakes from foods and dietary supplements are considered [ 18 ].\nCholine is important for fetal growth and the development of the central nervous system [ 10 ], but most pregnant women do not meet recommended intakes of choline during pregnancy [ 16 , 17 ]. Some studies have found associations between lower choline intakes and/or plasma or serum choline concentrations during pregnancy and an increased risk of NTDs, but not all studies agree with these findings [ 53-55 ]. Furthermore, plasma and serum choline concentrations are not good choline status indicators [ 53 ].\nA meta-analysis of 5,570 pregnant women across five case-control studies conducted in the United States or Canada [ 53 ] found the following:\nThere was a 36% higher risk of NTDs in the children of pregnant woman with low choline intakes or low circulating choline concentrations. For spina bifida specifically, there was a 33% higher risk in children of pregnant women with low maternal choline intake. There were no significant associations between material choline intake and the risk of anencephaly. However, the authors noted that the results should be interpreted with caution because of the limited number of studies included in the meta-analysis and possible recall bias.\nCurrently, there are no specific recommendations from professional societies, government agencies, or public health organizations for choline supplementation during pregnancy. However, as summarized in Table 4, consuming a variety of choline-containing foods is important during pregnancy, and supplementation may be warranted in some circumstances.\nMore information is available in the ODS choline fact sheet for health professionals .\n",
    "Folate/Folic Acid": "Folate is critical for proper embryonic and fetal development because of its role in cell division and nucleic acid synthesis. The RDA for folate increases during pregnancy to 600 mcg dietary folate equivalents. About one-third (35.8%) of pregnant women in the United States have dietary folate intakes that are below the EAR. Folate occurs in different forms including natural food folate, folic acid in fortified foods and dietary supplements, and other forms of folate in dietary supplements. Folic acid, specifically before and during the first 28 days after conception, reduces the risk of neural tube defects. Therefore, all women and adolescents who are capable of becoming pregnant should get 400 to 800 mcg/day folic acid from dietary supplements and/or fortified foods. Those who are at high risk of neural tube defects should get 4,000 to 5,000 mcg/day. Some dietary supplements contain folate as 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), but this form of folate has not been tested in clinical trials for reducing the risk of neural tube defects; folic acid is the only form of folate that is currently proven to reduce the risk of neural tube defects. The folate UL during pregnancy is 800 mcg/day for ages 14 to 18 years and 1,000 mcg/day for ages 19 to 50 years.\nFolate is a water-soluble B vitamin that occurs naturally as folate in foods, as folic acid in fortified foods and dietary supplements, and as other forms of folate in dietary supplements. Folate functions as a coenzyme or cosubstrate in single-carbon transfers during the synthesis of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the metabolism of amino acids [ 6 , 56 , 57 ]. It is also required for proper cell division.\nWhen consumed, folate undergoes a series of conversions to produce 5-MTHF, which is also known as L-5-MTHF, L-methylfolate, 5-methyl-folate, and methylfolate. This is the main active form of folate in plasma [ 56 ]. People with a genetic polymorphism, 677C>T, in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene have a reduced ability to convert folate to 5-MTHF because the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase enzyme needed for this conversion is less active [ 58 ]. About 25% of people who are Hispanic, 10% of people who are Caucasian or Asian, and 1% of people who are African American are homozygous for the 677C>T MTHFR polymorphism [ 59 ].\nThe RDA for folate during pregnancy is 600 mcg dietary folate equivalents (DFE), where 1 mcg DFE equals 1 mcg folate from food, 0.6 mcg folic acid from fortified foods or dietary supplements consumed with foods, or 0.5 mcg folic acid from dietary supplements taken on an empty stomach [ 6 ]. These values are higher than the value for nonpregnant females, which is 400 mcg DFE. Conversion factors between mcg DFE and mcg for supplemental folate in the form of 5-MTHF have not been formally established [ 60 ].\nFolate is naturally present in vegetables (especially dark green leafy vegetables), fruits and fruit juices, nuts, beans, peas, seafood, eggs, dairy products, meat, poultry, and grains [ 56 , 61 ]. Folic acid is also added to enriched breads, cereals, flours (including corn masa flour), pastas, rice, and other grain products as part of the folic acid fortification program in the United States to reduce the risk of NTDs [ 62 , 63 ]. Other countries around the world also have folic acid fortification programs.\nFolate, as either folic acid or 5-MTHF, is present in many dietary supplements [ 12 ]. This includes almost all prenatal supplements; according to a 2021 evaluation of 188 prenatal supplements on the U.S. market, 98% of these products included folate, with a median amount of 800 mcg/serving [ 30 ]. Another evaluation of 173 products found that nonprescription prenatal supplements contained a mean of 733 mcg (as mcg folic acid), while prescription products contained a mean of 1,062 mcg [ 20 ]. The form of folate used in prenatal supplements is an important consideration because the recommendations for reducing the risk of NTDs only apply to folic acid, not 5-MTHF [ 17 , 20 , 64 ]. According to a 2020 evaluation, approximately 32% of prescription prenatal products and 25% of nonprescription prenatal supplements on the U.S. market contain 5-MTHF [ 20 ].\nSome pregnant women in the United States do not obtain sufficient amounts of folate from their diets. An analysis of 2001–2014 NHANES data found that pregnant women age 20 to 40 years had a mean daily intake of folate from foods of 630 mcg DFE, and 35.8% of them consumed less than the EAR for folate [ 18 ]. Dietary supplements that contain folate can help pregnant women reach the recommended intake. When total intakes, including dietary supplements, are considered, the mean daily folate intake among pregnant women in the United States increases to 1,451 mcg DFE and the percentage of women who fall below the EAR decreases to 16.4% [ 18 ].\nSome pregnant women in the United States might obtain too much supplemental folate. The UL for supplemental folate during pregnancy is 800 mcg/day for ages 14 to 18 years and 1,000 mcg/day for ages 19 to 50 years. These values are the same as those for nonpregnant females and apply only to folate intakes from supplements and/or fortified foods, not folate that is naturally present in food [ 6 ]. According to 2001–2004 NHANES data, 33.4% of pregnant women age 20 to 40 years in the United States exceed the UL for supplemental folate [ 18 ]. Pregnant women who are non-Hispanic Black or non-Hispanic White may be more likely than those who are other races or ethnicities to have supplemental folate intakes that exceed the UL, according to data from the ECHO consortium [ 19 ].\nObtaining the recommended amount of folate before and during pregnancy is critical for proper embryonic and fetal development because of folate’s key role in cell division and nucleic acid synthesis.\nClear evidence from observational studies, clinical trials, and the folic acid food fortification program shows that a sufficient intake of folic acid before pregnancy and during early pregnancy (periconceptional intake) reduces the risk of NTDs [ 64-72 ]. Because NTDs occur within 28 days after conception when the neural tube closes, the critical window for folic acid intake runs from preconception through the first 28 days after conception. This is often before a woman is aware she is pregnant and may be prior to the first prenatal health care visit.\nFolic acid acts as a methyl group donor in one-carbon metabolism. This may be a mechanism by which it helps prevent NTDs [ 73 ]. An analysis of data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study indicates that higher intakes of other methyl donors and micronutrients that play a role in one-carbon metabolism, especially vitamin B6, vitamin B12, choline, betaine, and methionine, might further reduce NTD risk beyond folic acid alone [ 74 ].\nPregnant women with a 677C>T MTHFR polymorphism may have less biologically available 5-MTHF and, thus, reduced methylation potential, leading to an increased risk of NTDs [ 56 , 75 ]. A DNA analysis found that women who were homozygous for this polymorphism had a more than three times greater risk of having an infant affected by an NTD than those who were not [ 76 ]. Research on the effects of various forms of folate supplementation for women with this genetic polymorphism is ongoing [ 77 , 78 ]. A randomized trial in 60 pregnant women in Canada found that supplementation with 5-MTHF produced similar erythrocyte and serum folate concentrations as folic acid, while reducing maternal concentrations of unmetabolized folic acid [ 79 ]. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) still recommends supplementation with folic acid, not 5-MTHF, for those with MTHFR polymorphisms to reduce the risk of NTDs [ 80 ]. This is because 5-MTHF has not been tested in clinical trials for reducing the risk of NTDs; folic acid is the only form of folate that is currently proven to reduce the risk of NTDs.\nSome research suggests that folic acid supplementation might reduce the risk of other birth defects, such as cleft lip, cleft palate, and congenital heart defects. However, the authors of a 2015 Cochrane Review of five trials in 7,391 women concluded that the data are insufficient to determine if periconceptional folic acid affects birth defects other than NTDs [ 72 ]. In addition, it is unclear whether folic acid supplementation affects the risk of autism spectrum disorder [ 65 , 66 , 81-84 ].\nNumerous professional societies, government agencies, and public health organizations recommend folic acid supplementation both before and during early pregnancy to reduce the risk of giving birth to an infant with an NTD. These recommendations are summarized in Table 5.\nMore information is available in the ODS folate fact sheet for health professionals .\n",
    "Iodine": "Iodine is crucial for proper thyroid function and fetal neurodevelopment. The RDA for iodine increases during pregnancy to 220 mcg. The median dietary iodine intake is 216 mcg/day among pregnant women in the United States. People who follow a vegetarian or vegan diet or who do not use iodized salt are at a higher risk of having an insufficient dietary iodine intake. Many professional organizations recommend taking iodine supplements before and during pregnancy, typically at a daily dose of 150 mcg. However, not all prenatal supplements contain iodine. The iodine UL during pregnancy is 900 mcg/day for ages 14 to 18 years and 1,100 mcg/day for ages 19 to 50 years.\nIodine is an essential component of the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Thyroid hormones regulate many important biochemical reactions, including protein synthesis and enzymatic activity, and are critical determinants of metabolic activity [ 8 , 91 , 92 ]. They are also required for proper fetal and infant skeletal and central nervous system development.\nThe RDA for iodine during pregnancy is 220 mcg [ 8 ]. This value is higher than the RDA for nonpregnant females, which is 150 mcg. The WHO, United Nations Children’s Fund, and the International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders recommend a slightly higher iodine intake of 250 mcg/day during pregnancy [ 93 , 94 ].\nIodine is present in seaweed, fish and other seafood, iodized salt, dairy products, and eggs [ 91 , 95 , 96 ]. In addition, some commercially prepared bread contains iodine if the manufacturer uses potassium iodate or calcium iodate as dough conditioners. The ingredients list on bread product labels will include these dough conditioners if they are present in the product. The salt contained in processed foods is almost always noniodized salt, so it does not provide iodine.\nIodine is available in many dietary supplements, including some, but not all, prenatal supplements [ 12 , 22 ]. According to a 2021 evaluation of 188 prenatal supplements on the U.S. market, 76% of these products included iodine, with a median amount of 150 mcg/serving [ 30 ]. Another evaluation of 214 products found that nonprescription prenatal supplements contained a mean of 164 mcg of iodine, while prescription products contained a mean of 150 mcg [ 11 ].\nSome pregnant women in the United States do not obtain sufficient amounts of iodine from their diet, especially those who follow vegetarian or vegan diets or do not use iodized salt [ 96-98 ]. An analysis of 2017–2020 NHANES data found that pregnant women had a median daily intake of iodine from foods of 216 mcg [ 99 ]. Dietary supplements that contain iodine can help pregnant women reach the recommended intake of iodine. When total intakes, including dietary supplements, are considered, pregnant women have a median daily iodine intake of 235 mcg and 10.2% of them have an intake that is below the EAR [ 99 ].\nUrinary iodine concentration (UIC) is a common measure of iodine status, and median UIC, from spot samples collected as part of a large survey, can be used to characterize the iodine status of populations [ 100 , 101 ]. A median UIC of 150 to 249 mcg/L in a population indicates adequate iodine nutrition during pregnancy, while values less than 150 mcg/L indicate insufficient iodine nutrition [ 93 , 100 ]. Based on UIC measurements, a substantial proportion of pregnant women in the United States are iodine insufficient [ 99 , 102 ]. An analysis of 2017–2020 NHANES data found that pregnant women had a median UIC of 131.4 mcg/L, and 63.2% were below the threshold for sufficiency of 150 mcg/L [ 99 ].\nPregnant women in the United States rarely get excessive amounts of iodine. The UL for iodine during pregnancy is 900 mcg/day for ages 14 to 18 years and 1,100 mcg/day for ages 19 to 50 years [ 4 ]. These values are the same as those for nonpregnant females. An analysis of 2001–2014 NHANES data found that 0% of pregnant women age 20 to 40 years exceed the iodine UL when total iodine intakes from foods and dietary supplements are considered [ 99 ].\nObtaining the recommended amount of iodine during pregnancy is crucial for proper fetal development. Iodine deficiency, which results from inadequate thyroid hormone production due to insufficient iodine, has multiple adverse effects on growth and development; severe deficiency is the most common cause of preventable intellectual disability in the world [ 94 , 103 , 104 ]. Congenital hypothyroidism (formerly known as cretinism) is the most recognized effect of severe iodine deficiency during pregnancy. It is characterized by severe, irreversible mental impairment, stunting, deaf mutism, and other physical abnormalities [ 104 ]. Severe iodine deficiency is also associated with higher risks of stillbirth, miscarriage, congenital abnormalities, and perinatal mortality [ 91 , 104 ].\nAlthough severe iodine deficiency disorders are uncommon in the United States, mild-to-moderate iodine insufficiency during pregnancy has been documented in this country and may subtly affect fetal development [ 102 , 105-107 ]. A meta-analysis of 6,180 mother-child pairs from three birth cohorts in the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom found that the verbal IQ of children at 1.5 to 8 years of age was lower if their mothers had lower iodine status in their first trimester of pregnancy [ 108 ]. Other research has found inconsistent associations between maternal UIC and/or dietary iodine intake and neurodevelopmental outcomes in the child [ 109 ].\nIodine deficiency may also cause delays in conception. A U.S. population-based prospective cohort study found that women with moderate to severe iodine deficiency were 46% less likely to become pregnant over each menstrual cycle compared to women with adequate iodine status [ 110 ]. In contrast, iodine deficiency has not been associated with the risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, stillbirth, or pregnancy loss, such as miscarriage [ 111-114 ].\nThe use of iodized salt and iodine-containing supplements during pregnancy can help ensure proper iodine status, but the effects of iodine supplements during pregnancy on infant and child neurodevelopment are not well understood [ 115-117 ]. In addition, both low and high iodine intakes during pregnancy are associated with neurodevelopmental deficits in children [ 118-120 ]. This raises questions about the potential adverse effects of iodine supplementation in pregnant women with sufficient iodine status or mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency. Many scientists have called for more research in this area [ 120 , 121 ].\nA 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis examined the available evidence on the effects of iodine supplementation during pregnancy on maternal and infant thyroid function and child cognition in settings with mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency [ 122 ]. The review included 10 RCTs, four non-RCT interventions, and 23 observational studies in pregnant women with mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency. It found the following:\nIodine supplementation did not affect child cognitive, language, or motor scores based on limited data from one adequately powered RCT. Maternal iodine supplementation did not affect neurodevelopment and had inconsistent effects on motor development in the observational studies and non-RCT interventional studies. Iodine supplementation reduced maternal thyroglobulin concentrations in most of the studies but did not affect maternal or infant thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine.\nA 2017 Cochrane Review included 14 trials that investigated the effects of iodine supplementation during the preconceptional, pregnancy, or postpartum periods on maternal and child outcomes [ 123 ]. The trials were conducted in Europe, Australia, Chile, Morocco, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Thailand, and Zaire and they administered iodine alone or in combination with other vitamins and minerals. All but one trial reported baseline iodine status, and measurements indicated that participants had insufficient iodine intake (e.g., median UIC below 150 mcg/L). The review found the following:\nIodine supplements reduced the risk of postpartum maternal hyperthyroidism by 68%, although this evidence was judged to be low quality. Iodine supplements did not affect the risk of perinatal mortality, low birthweight, neonatal hypothyroidism/elevated thyroid stimulating hormone, or elevated neonatal thyroid peroxidase antibodies. However, the evidence supporting these findings was judged to be very low to low quality.\nMany professional societies and public health organizations recommend iodine supplementation during pregnancy. These recommendations are summarized in Table 6.\nMore information is available in the ODS iodine fact sheet for health professionals .\n",
    "Magnesium": "Magnesium is important for fetal growth and development due to its involvement in numerous biochemical reactions in the body. The RDA for magnesium increases during pregnancy to 400 mg for ages 14 to 18 years, 350 mg for ages 19 to 30 years, and 360 mg for ages 31 to 50 years. About half (53.3%) of pregnant women in the United States have dietary magnesium intakes that are below the EAR. Dietary supplements that contain magnesium can help increase intakes to the recommended amounts. Magnesium supplementation might have some benefits during pregnancy, including reducing the risk of preeclampsia in some women; however, study results have been mixed. The UL for supplemental magnesium during pregnancy is 350 mg/day; dietary magnesium does not have a UL.\nMagnesium is a cofactor in more than 600 enzyme systems that regulate diverse biochemical reactions in the body, including protein synthesis, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control, and blood pressure regulation [ 5 , 150-153 ]. Magnesium also contributes to the structural development of bone and is required for the activation of vitamin D and the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and the antioxidant glutathione [ 154 , 155 ].\nThe RDA for magnesium during pregnancy is 400 mg for ages 14 to 18 years, 350 mg for ages 19 to 30 years, and 360 mg for ages 31 to 50 years [ 5 ]. These values are higher than the RDAs for nonpregnant females age 14 to 18 years (360 mg), age 19 to 30 years (310 mg), and age 31 to 50 years (320 mg).\nCompared with standard reference body weights, higher body weights may increase magnesium requirements, and some experts believe that the magnesium DRIs, including the RDAs, should be recalculated to be higher than the current values [ 156 ]. This warrants further research. However, like other essential micronutrients, the current DRIs during pregnancy and other life stages do not differ by body weight, and the DRIs for magnesium that were established in 1997 remain in place at this time [ 5 ].\nGood sources of magnesium include some green leafy vegetables, such as spinach, as well as legumes, nuts, seeds, and whole grains [ 5 , 153 ].\nMagnesium is available in many dietary supplements, including some, but not all, prenatal supplements [ 12 ]. The authors of a 2021 evaluation of 188 prenatal supplements on the U.S. market reported that 66% of these products included magnesium, with a median amount of 50 mg/serving [ 30 ].\nMany people in the United States, including those who are pregnant, do not obtain sufficient amounts of magnesium. According to NHANES data from 2001–2014, pregnant women ages 20 to 40 years had a mean daily intake of 294 mg of magnesium from foods, and 53.3% of them were consuming less than the EAR for magnesium [ 18 ]. Dietary supplements that contain magnesium can help pregnant women reach the recommended intake of magnesium, but when total intakes, including dietary supplements, are considered, the mean daily magnesium intake among pregnant women in the United States is 314 mg and 47.5% of women still fall below the EAR [ 18 ]. According to data from the ECHO consortium, some pregnant women may be more likely than others to have total magnesium intakes from foods and supplements below the EAR. These include women who are age 14 to 30 years, Hispanic or non-Hispanic Black, overweight or obese, or have less than a high school education [ 19 ].\nThe UL for magnesium during pregnancy is 350 mg/day [ 4 ]. This value is the same as that for nonpregnant females, and it applies to supplemental magnesium only; magnesium found naturally in foods and beverages does not have a UL. Less than 0.5% of pregnant women age 20 to 40 years in the United States exceed the magnesium UL, according to 2001–2014 NHANES data [ 18 ].\nAdequate magnesium status during pregnancy is important for fetal growth and development [ 157 ]. Studies have examined whether magnesium supplementation affects the risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, small for gestational age, perinatal mortality, and leg cramps [ 158-162 ]. Findings from these studies have been mixed. However, results suggest that magnesium supplements might be beneficial in some cases.\nA 2014 Cochrane Review included 10 RCTs of magnesium supplements during pregnancy in 9,090 women and their infants [ 161 ]. Trials were conducted in several countries including Austria, China, Hungary, Italy, the United States, and South Africa. Doses of magnesium varied from 55 to 600 mg/day, and supplementation was initiated at 6 weeks gestation or later and typically lasted until birth. The review found the following:\nMagnesium supplementation during pregnancy had no effect on perinatal mortality or on small for gestational age. Magnesium supplementation did not affect risk of preeclampsia.\nA more recent meta-analysis of seven RCTs in 2,653 pregnant women [ 162 ] found the following:\nMagnesium supplementation reduced the risk of preeclampsia by 24% but did not affect the risk of severe preeclampsia. Subgroup analyses found that magnesium supplements reduced the risk of preeclampsia only in trials that included high-risk pregnancies, not in those that did not.\nAnother meta-analysis of six RCTs in 3,068 pregnant women found that magnesium supplementation reduced the risk of preterm birth by 42%. However, there was significant heterogeneity among studies [ 160 ].\nMagnesium deficiency can cause leg cramps, but the authors of a 2015 Cochrane Review of four RCTs concluded that it is unclear whether magnesium supplements reduce the incidence of leg cramps during pregnancy [ 40 ].\nCurrently, there are no specific recommendations from professional societies, government agencies, or public health organizations for magnesium supplementation during pregnancy.\nMore information is available in the ODS magnesium health professional fact sheet .\n",
    "Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Seafood": "Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are critical nutrients for fetal growth and development, especially for brain and eye development. The AI for alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) increases during pregnancy to 1.4 mg. Intake recommendations for the long-chain omega-3s, including DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), have not been established. However, intake of seafood, which is the best source of long-chain omega-3s, is associated with favorable measures of cognitive development in young children. Expert groups recommend that pregnant women consume 8 to 12 ounces of seafood per week, choosing varieties that are lower in mercury. Research indicates that long-chain omega-3s reduce the risk of preterm birth, so experts recommend that all women of childbearing age consume at least 250 mg/day of DHA plus EPA from diet or supplements, and an additional 100 to 200 mg/day of DHA during pregnancy. Most women who are pregnant do not meet these recommendations. Dietary supplements that contain DHA and EPA can help increase intakes and may be particularly useful for people who do not consume seafood, such as those who follow a vegetarian diet.\nOmega-3 fatty acids include the essential fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and the long-chain fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The body uses long-chain omega-3s to produce lipid mediators, such as eicosanoids (e.g., prostaglandins, leukotrienes) and inflammation resolving mediators (e.g., resolvins). Long-chain omega-3s are also used to form structural components of cell membranes, such as phospholipids [ 2 , 17 , 163 ].\nALA is present only in plant foods, including walnuts, flax seed, and canola oil [ 164 ]. DHA and EPA are present in fish and other seafood. Fatty fish, such as salmon, sardines, and tuna, are particularly rich sources of long-chain omega-3s. Seafood contains varying levels of methylmercury, but numerous studies, including systematic reviews, show that the health benefits of consuming seafood during the prenatal period outweigh the potential risks [ 165-167 ]. Nevertheless, U.S. government agencies encourage women who are pregnant to choose varieties of seafood that are lower in mercury, such as salmon, anchovies, sardines, Pacific oysters, and trout [ 17 , 168 ].\nThe AI for ALA during pregnancy is 1.4 g [ 2 ]. This value is higher than the AI of 1.1 g for nonpregnant females age 14 to 50 years.\nRecommended intakes for long-chain omega-3s during pregnancy have not been established, but many expert groups recommend consuming 8 to 12 ounces of seafood per week, which would provide approximately 250 mg/day of DHA plus EPA [ 17 , 168 , 169 ]. Most women who are pregnant do not meet this recommendation [ 170 ]. According to an analysis of 2001–2014 NHANES data, the mean intake of seafood among pregnant women age 15 to 44 years is 0.44 ounces per day, or about 3 ounces per week [ 171 ]. The same analysis found that pregnant women age 20 to 40 years have an average daily DHA intake of 60.3 mg from food and 76.7 mg from food and supplements. When combined with EPA, the total average daily intake of DHA plus EPA from food is 78.7 mg and the average daily intake from food and supplements is 97.7 mg. Pregnant women who are Black are more likely than others to have low DHA intakes [ 172 ].\nLong-chain omega-3s from marine (e.g., fish oil) or vegetarian (i.e., algal) sources are present in some dietary supplements. These products can help pregnant women obtain recommended amounts of long-chain omega-3s, especially those who do not eat seafood. However, omega-3s are not typically included in standard multivitamin/mineral supplements and only 35 to 39% of prescription and nonprescription prenatal supplements contain DHA [ 11 , 12 , 173 ]. Among prenatal supplements that do contain omega-3s, the average level of DHA is 368 mg in U.S. products and 404 mg in Canadian products, according to a 2024 evaluation of 68 prenatal supplements [ 174 ].\nOmega-3s do not have a UL, although ALA has an acceptable macronutrient distribution range of 0.6% to 1.2% of energy for adults and children age 1 year and older [ 2 ]. The authors of a 2024 clinical practice guideline state that intakes up to 1,000 mg/day of DHA or DHA and EPA do not raise safety concerns in women who are pregnant [ 169 ].\nObtaining sufficient amounts of long-chain omega-3s, particularly DHA, during pregnancy is important for maternal health and fetal growth and development. DHA is concentrated in the brain and the retina and accumulates most rapidly during the third trimester of pregnancy [ 2 , 175 ]. Many observational studies link higher maternal intakes of fish and other seafood with improved child health outcomes [ 170 , 176-178 ]. One systematic review included 29 prospective cohort studies in 102,944 healthy mother-offspring pairs [ 167 ]. The studies were conducted in the United States, Europe, the United Kingdom, Asia, and Africa, and the authors found the following:\nMaternal seafood consumption of 4 ounces/week was associated with improved neurocognitive development, and these improvements continued with intakes of more than 12 ounces/week. No net adverse neurocognitive outcomes were reported at the highest ranges of maternal seafood intakes (30 ounces/week or more) despite the associated increases in mercury exposure.\nResults from RCTs have not shown consistent benefits from maternal supplementation with EPA and/or DHA during pregnancy on infant cognition or visual development [ 175 , 179 ]. However, long-chain omega-3 supplements, particularly DHA, have been shown to reduce the risk of preterm and early preterm birth [ 169 , 180 ].\nA 2018 Cochrane Review assessed the effects of long-chain omega-3s from supplements and/or foods during pregnancy on maternal and neonatal outcomes in 19,927 women [ 181 ]. It included 70 RCTs, that were conducted in multiple countries, including 16 trials in the United States, 8 in Iran, 6 in the United Kingdom, and 4 in the Netherlands. Fifty of the trials administered supplements that contained only omega-3s, while the remainder administered omega-3s as food or combination products. Based on a high quality of evidence, the authors concluded the following:\nLong-chain omega-3s reduced the risk of preterm birth (birth at <37 weeks) by 11%, and the risk of early preterm birth (birth at <34 weeks) by 42%. Long-chain omega-3s also reduced the risk of low birthweight.\nA 2022 statement from the International Society for the Study of Fatty Acids and Lipids that included two large trials that were published after the Cochrane Review confirmed these findings, showing a 12% reduction in the risk of preterm birth and a 35% reduction in the risk of early preterm birth among those taking long-chain omega-3 supplements [ 182 ].\nA 2016 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) report evaluated the results of 95 RCTs and 48 prospective, longitudinal studies, and case-control studies from around the world [ 183 ]. It found that long-chain omega-3 supplementation during pregnancy slightly increased gestational length and birth weight compared with placebo but had no consistent effects on other maternal and child health outcomes.\nIn addition, some, but not all, RCTs have found that maternal supplementation with EPA and/or DHA during pregnancy improves immune function and reduces the incidence of severe atopic dermatitis, food sensitivities, and/or asthma in the child [ 163 ]. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings.\nDespite these potential health benefits, many pregnant women do not meet the recommended seafood intake of 8 to 12 ounces per week [ 170 ]. Thus, they likely have intakes of long-chain omega-3s that do not meet recommended amounts. In addition to long-chain omega-3s, seafood provides other essential nutrients including vitamin D, calcium, potassium, iron, choline, iodine, and magnesium.\nSeveral professional societies, government agencies, and public health organizations recommend seafood consumption during pregnancy, and some recommend additional DHA and/or EPA intake. These recommendations are summarized in Table 8.\nMore information is available in the ODS omega-3 fatty acids fact sheet for health professionals .\n",
    "Vitamin A": "Vitamin A is an important nutrient for fetal and maternal health, and it has two main forms: preformed vitamin A and provitamin A carotenoids, including beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin. The RDA for vitamin A increases during pregnancy to 750 mcg retinol activity equivalents (RAE) for ages 14 to 18 years and 770 mcg RAE for ages 19 to 50 years. Frank vitamin A deficiency is uncommon in the United States, but about one-quarter (27.7%) of pregnant women have dietary vitamin A intakes that are below the EAR. Study results have been mixed, but vitamin A supplementation during pregnancy may have some maternal and fetal benefits, especially in women who live in countries where vitamin A deficiency is common and in those who have health complications, such as HIV. The UL during pregnancy for preformed vitamin A is 2,800 mcg/day for ages 14 to 18 years and 3,000 mcg/day for ages 19 to 50 years. Beta-carotene and other provitamin A carotenoids do not have a UL. Excessive intakes of preformed vitamin A—but not beta-carotene or other provitamin A carotenoids—can cause birth defects, so it is important for women who are pregnant to keep preformed vitamin A intakes well below the UL.\nVitamin A refers to a group of fat-soluble compounds [ 187 , 188 ]. It has two main forms: preformed vitamin A (retinol and retinyl esters) and provitamin A carotenoids, including beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin. The body can convert provitamin A carotenoids into vitamin A.\nVitamin A is involved in immune function; cellular communication; growth and development; male and female reproduction; and the formation and maintenance of the heart, lungs, eyes, and other organs. It is particularly important for vision [ 7 , 187-189 ].\nThe unit of measurement for vitamin A is mcg retinol activity equivalents (RAE) to account for the different bioactivities of retinol and provitamin A carotenoids, but International Units (IUs) were previously used [ 60 ]. Conversions from IU to mcg RAE are as follows [ 190-192 ]:\n1 IU retinol = 0.3 mcg RAE 1 IU supplemental beta-carotene = 0.3 mcg RAE 1 IU dietary beta-carotene = 0.05 mcg RAE 1 IU dietary alpha-carotene or beta-cryptoxanthin = 0.025 mcg RAE\nThe RDA for vitamin A during pregnancy is 750 mcg RAE for ages 14 to18 years and 770 mcg RAE for ages 19 to 50 years [ 8 ]. These values are higher than the RDA for nonpregnant females of 700 mcg day for ages 14 and older.\nAnimal products, such as dairy, eggs, fish, and organ meats, are good dietary sources of preformed vitamin A. Provitamin A carotenoids are present in plant foods including leafy green vegetables, orange and yellow vegetables, tomatoes, fruits, and some vegetable oils [ 8 , 187 , 193 ]. Vitamin A is routinely added as a fortificant to some foods, including milk and margarine [ 187 , 188 ].\nVitamin A is available in many dietary supplements, including many prenatal supplements [ 12 ]. A 2022 evaluation of 188 prenatal supplements on the U.S. market found that 73% of prenatal supplements included beta-carotene, with a median amount of 3,040 IU/serving [ 23 ]. The same evaluation found that 35% of prenatal supplements included preformed vitamin A, with a median amount of 2,487 IU/serving.\nFrank vitamin A deficiency is rare in the United States, but some women who are pregnant do not obtain sufficient amounts of vitamin A from their diet [ 187 ]. An analysis of 2001–2014 NHANES data found that pregnant women age 20 to 40 had a mean dietary vitamin A intake of 696 mcg/day, and 27.7% of them were consuming less than the EAR for vitamin A [ 18 ]. Dietary supplements that contain vitamin A can help pregnant women reach the recommended intake of vitamin A. When dietary supplement intakes are included, the mean daily vitamin A intake among pregnant women in the United States increases to 1,283 mcg and the percentage of women who fall below the EAR decreases to 15.5% [ 18 ].\nThe UL for preformed vitamin A during pregnancy is 2,800 mcg/day for ages 14 to 18 years and 3,000 mcg/day for ages 19 to 50 years [ 8 ]. These values are the same as those for nonpregnant females. Beta-carotene and other provitamin A carotenoids do not have a UL.\nExcessive intakes of preformed vitamin A during pregnancy can cause congenital birth defects, including malformations of the eye, skull, lungs, and heart [ 187 , 193 ]. Therefore, women who are or who might be pregnant should not take high doses of supplements that contain preformed vitamin A and should be aware that some prescription medications contain synthetic retinoids derived from vitamin A. Beta-carotene and other provitamin A carotenoids, however, are not known to cause reproductive toxicity [ 187 ].\nLess than 0.5% of pregnant women age 20 to 40 years in the United States have total intakes that exceed the UL for preformed vitamin A, according to 2001–2014 NHANES data [ 18 ].\nObtaining the recommended amount of vitamin A during pregnancy is important for both fetal and maternal health. Several studies have examined whether supplemental vitamin A affects pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth and low birthweight, but results from these studies have been inconsistent.\nA 2023 meta-analysis included 55 studies that evaluated perinatal growth outcomes in a total of 426,098 pregnancies in low-, middle-, and high-income countries around the world [ 194 ]. These studies evaluated the effects of vitamin A supplements alone; in combination with other micronutrients; or with other interventions, including dietary patterns that were rich in vitamin A. The analysis found the following:\nVitamin A decreased the risk of preterm birth by 19% and the risk of low birthweight by 16%. In RCTs that administered vitamin A supplementation alone: The risk of preterm birth was reduced by 9% in healthy mothers but not in mothers with health complications, such as those with HIV or night blindness. The risk of low birthweight was reduced by 24% in mothers with health complications but not in healthy mothers. Vitamin A did not affect the risk of neonatal birth defects.\nThe risk of preterm birth was reduced by 9% in healthy mothers but not in mothers with health complications, such as those with HIV or night blindness. The risk of low birthweight was reduced by 24% in mothers with health complications but not in healthy mothers.\nA 2015 Cochrane Review also evaluated vitamin A supplementation during pregnancy and included 19 trials in more than 310,00 pregnant women in low-, middle-, and high-income countries [ 195 ]. The review found the following:\nVitamin A supplementation did not affect the risk of maternal mortality, perinatal mortality, neonatal mortality, stillbirth, neonatal anemia, preterm birth, or low birthweight. Vitamin A supplementation reduced the risk of maternal night blindness and anemia. It also reduced the risk of maternal clinical infection, but the quality of this evidence was judged to be low.\nThe authors concluded that vitamin A supplementation during pregnancy reduces the risk of anemia and night blindness in women who live in areas where vitamin A deficiency is common or in those with HIV.\nAs summarized in Table 9, WHO recommends vitamin A supplementation only in certain circumstances to prevent night blindness [ 196 ]. Currently, there are no other recommendations from professional societies, government agencies, or public health organizations for vitamin A supplementation during pregnancy.\nMore information is available in the ODS fact sheet on vitamin A for health professionals .\n",
    "Vitamin B6": "Vitamin B6 plays an important role in the development and function of the nervous system. The RDA for vitamin B6 increases during pregnancy to 1.9 mg. About one-quarter (25.4%) of pregnant women in the United States have dietary vitamin B6 intakes that are below the EAR. Dietary supplements that contain vitamin B6 can help increase intakes to recommended amounts. Research indicates that vitamin B6 supplementation helps reduce nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, but its effects on other pregnancy outcomes are unclear. The UL for vitamin B6 during pregnancy is 100 mg/day, and the doses that are recommended for alleviating nausea and vomiting during pregnancy can approach this amount. The European Food Safety Authority has set an upper limit for vitamin B6 of 12 mg/day.\nVitamin B6 (also called pyridoxine) is the generic name for six compounds with vitamin B6 activity that the body converts to the coenzyme pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP). Through PLP, vitamin B6 is involved with almost all aspects of metabolism and cellular homeostasis, including protein metabolism, one-carbon metabolism, gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, and hemoglobin formation [ 6 , 197 ]. PLP is also required for neurotransmitter metabolism, which is important for cognitive development.\nThe RDA for vitamin B6 during pregnancy is 1.9 mg [ 6 ]. This value is higher than the RDA of 1.2 mg for nonpregnant females age 14 to 18 years and the RDA of 1.3 mg for those age 19 to 50 years.\nGood sources of vitamin B6 include fish, beef, poultry, organ meats, and potatoes and other starchy vegetables [ 6 , 197 ]. Some noncitrus fruits, such as bananas, raisins, and watermelon, also contain vitamin B6.\nVitamin B6 is available in many dietary supplements [ 12 ]. This includes almost all prenatal supplements; a 2022 evaluation of 188 prenatal supplements on the U.S. market found that 97% of these products included vitamin B6, with a median amount of 5 mg/serving [ 23 ].\nSome pregnant women in the United States do not obtain sufficient amounts of vitamin B6. According to NHANES data from 2001–2014, pregnant women age 20 to 40 years had a mean daily intake of vitamin B6 from foods of 2.1 mg, and 25.4% of them were consuming less than the EAR for vitamin B6 [ 18 ]. Dietary supplements that contain vitamin B6 can help pregnant women reach the recommended amounts. When total intakes, including dietary supplements, are considered, the mean daily vitamin B6 intake among pregnant women in the United States increases to 7.8 mg, and the percentage of women who fall below the EAR decreases to 11.5% [ 18 ].\nThe UL for vitamin B6 during pregnancy is 100 mg/day [ 4 ]. This is the same as the value for nonpregnant females age 14 to 50 years. The UL is virtually impossible to reach from food intake alone. Although some dietary supplements contain high doses of vitamin B6 [ 12 ], 2001–2014 NHANES data indicate that less than 0.5% of pregnant women age 20 to 40 years in the United States have total vitamin B6 intakes from foods and dietary supplements that exceed the UL [ 18 ].\nThe Panel on Nutrition, Novel Foods and Food Allergens of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has set an upper limit for vitamin B6 of 12 mg/day for all adults, including those who are pregnant [ 198 ]. This value is substantially lower than the 100 mg/day UL set by the FNB [ 6 ].\nAdequate vitamin B6 status during pregnancy is important for proper nervous system development and function, and a deficiency might increase the risk of preterm birth and preeclampsia [ 23 , 86 ]. Most studies that have evaluated the use of vitamin B6 supplementation during pregnancy have focused on alleviating nausea and vomiting, but some studies have evaluated other outcomes.\nA 2015 Cochrane Review evaluated the use of vitamin B6, among other interventions, to alleviate nausea and vomiting during early pregnancy [ 199 ]. The review included only two clinical trials, one conducted in the United States [ 200 ] and the other in Thailand [ 201 ], that compared the use of vitamin B6 with placebo. These trials found that 30 to 75 mg of vitamin B6 per day decreased nausea in pregnant women. However, the Cochrane Review authors concluded that there was only limited evidence to support the use of vitamin B6 for this purpose [ 199 ].\nVitamin B6 has also been studied in combination with doxylamine (an antihistamine). Clinical trials have found that this combination reduces nausea and vomiting during pregnancy by 70% [ 202 , 203 ].\nA 2015 Cochrane Review examined the effects of vitamin B6 supplements on pregnancy outcomes other than nausea and vomiting [ 204 ]. The review included four RCTs that evaluated the use of vitamin B6 supplements during pregnancy in 1,646 women. In three of the trials, the doses of vitamin B6 ranged from 2.6 to 25 mg/day and supplementation was initiated at various gestational ages until delivery. In the fourth trial, a single dose of 100 mg was administered 2 to 10 hours before birth. The authors of the review reported that vitamin B6 supplementation did not affect the risk of eclampsia or preeclampsia, although this finding was based on a low quality of evidence.\nA couple of professional societies and public health organizations recommend vitamin B6 supplementation during pregnancy to alleviate nausea and vomiting. These recommendations are summarized in Table 10.\nMore information is available in the ODS vitamin B6 fact sheet for health professionals .\n",
    "Vitamin B12": "Vitamin B12 is an important nutrient for a healthy pregnancy and fetal development, including central nervous system development. The RDA for vitamin B12 increases during pregnancy to 2.6 mcg. Most pregnant women in the United States consume sufficient amounts of vitamin B12. However, people who consume few or no animal products, such as those who follow a vegetarian or vegan diet, are at increased risk of vitamin B12 deficiency and may benefit from a vitamin B12 supplement. Most prenatal supplements contain vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 supplementation during pregnancy might improve maternal and infant B12 status, but its effects on other health outcomes are unclear. Vitamin B12 does not have a UL.\nVitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin that is required for central nervous system function, healthy red blood cell formation, and the synthesis of DNA and RNA [ 6 , 206 , 207 ]. It contains the mineral cobalt, so compounds that have vitamin B12 activity are collectively called cobalamins.\nThe RDA for vitamin B12 during pregnancy is 2.6 mcg [ 6 ]. This is higher than the RDA of 2.4 mcg for nonpregnant females age 14 years and older.\nVitamin B12 is present in animal foods, including fish, meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy products [ 207-209 ]. Plant foods do not naturally contain vitamin B12. However, some foods, such as plant-based milk substitutes, breakfast cereals, and nutritional yeasts, are fortified with vitamin B12.\nVitamin B12 is available in many dietary supplements [ 12 ]. This includes almost all prenatal supplements; a 2022 evaluation of 188 prenatal supplements on the U.S. market found that 97% of these products included vitamin B12, with a median amount of 8.5 mcg/serving [ 23 ].\nMost pregnant women in the United States obtain sufficient amounts of vitamin B12. An analysis of 2001–2014 NHANES data found that the average daily vitamin B12 intake from foods alone in pregnant women was 5.6 mcg, and only 2.4% of these women did not meet the EAR for vitamin B12 [ 18 ]. However, because vitamin B12 is present only in animal products and some fortified foods, pregnant women who follow a vegetarian or vegan diet have an increased risk of inadequate vitamin B12 intakes [ 210 ]. Consuming foods that are fortified with vitamin B12 and vitamin B12 supplements can substantially reduce the risk of deficiency. When total intakes, including dietary supplements, are considered, the mean daily vitamin B12 intake among pregnant women in the United States increases to 19.2 mcg and the percentage of women who fall below the EAR decreases to 1.4% [ 18 ].\nCertain conditions, such as pernicious anemia and achlorhydria, cause malabsorption of vitamin B12. Malabsorption can also occur in people who take proton pump inhibitors. This can result in vitamin B12 deficiency despite adequate oral intakes [ 207 , 211 ]. Pernicious anemia is usually treated with intramuscular vitamin B12 injections to bypass any barriers to absorption.\nVitamin B12 does not have a UL for any age group [ 6 ].\nVitamin B12 deficiency during pregnancy can cause maternal and infant anemia and might increase the risk of NTDs, failure to thrive, spontaneous abortion, low birthweight, and developmental delays [ 211-216 ]. In addition, pregnant women with preeclampsia have been found to have lower vitamin B12 concentrations than those who are normotensive [ 217 ]. Vitamin B12 intake during pregnancy also affects fetal vitamin B12 stores because these develop in utero [ 10 ].\nDespite the importance of vitamin B12 during pregnancy, research on the effects of vitamin B12 supplementation on maternal and infant health outcomes is limited [ 216 , 218 ].\nA 2024 Cochrane Review included five trials that evaluated the effects of vitamin B12 supplementation in 984 pregnant women in India, Bangladesh, South Africa, and Croatia [ 216 ]. Twenty-six percent to 51% of these women were vitamin B12 deficient. The authors concluded that vitamin B12 supplements:\nMay improve B12 status during pregnancy and postpartum, but the certainty of this evidence was very low. Appear to improve infant vitamin B12 status. Have uncertain effects on clinical or functional health outcomes, including preterm birth and low birthweight.\nTable 11 summarizes recommendations from the 2020–2025 DGA and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics for vitamin B12 supplementation during pregnancy for women who follow vegetarian or vegan diets. Other experts also recommend vitamin B12 supplementation during pregnancy for women with known vitamin B12 deficiency or those who are at high risk of deficiency, such as those who follow vegan or vegetarian diets [ 211 , 212 ].\nMore information is available in the ODS fact sheet on vitamin B12 for health professionals .\n",
    "Vitamin D": "Vitamin D is required for proper fetal development, particularly for bone growth. The RDA for vitamin D during pregnancy is 15 mcg. About 90% of pregnant women in the United States have vitamin D intakes that are below the EAR. Most prenatal supplements on the U.S. market contain vitamin D and the use of these products, or other supplements that contain vitamin D, can help pregnant women get recommended amounts of vitamin D. Vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of preeclampsia, but additional research is needed. The UL for vitamin D during pregnancy is 100 mcg/day.\nVitamin D, also known as calciferol, is a fat-soluble vitamin that exists in two main forms: vitamin D2 and vitamin D3. Because vitamin D promotes calcium absorption and enables normal bone mineralization, it is important for bone health. It also plays a role in inflammation, cell growth, neuromuscular and immune function, and glucose metabolism [ 4 , 219-221 ].\nThe current unit of measurement for vitamin D is mcg, but IUs were used in the past; 1 mcg vitamin D is equal to 40 IU [ 191 ]. The RDA for vitamin D during pregnancy is 15 mcg (600 IU) [ 4 ]. This is the same as the value for nonpregnant females age 14 to 50 years.\nThe main dietary sources of vitamin D are the flesh of fatty fish (trout, salmon, tuna, and mackerel) and fish liver oils. Beef liver, egg yolks, and cheese have small amounts of vitamin D. Almost all of the U.S. milk supply is fortified with vitamin D, and some plant-based milk substitutes are also fortified with vitamin D [ 4 , 219 ]. People in the United States get most of their vitamin D from fortified foods [ 4 , 222 ]. The body also makes vitamin D from sun exposure, and most people meet at least some of their vitamin D needs through this means [ 4 ].\nVitamin D is available in many dietary supplements [ 12 ]. This includes almost all prenatal supplements; a 2022 evaluation of 188 prenatal supplements on the U.S. market found that 98% of these products included vitamin D, with a median amount of 550 IU (13.8 mcg)/serving [ 23 ]. Another evaluation of 214 products found that nonprescription prenatal supplements contained a mean of 646 IU (16.2 mcg), while prescription products contained a mean of 462 IU (11.6 mcg) [ 11 ].\nAccording to the 2020–2025 DGA, vitamin D is a nutrient of public health concern because it is underconsumed by the U.S. population [ 17 ]. Similarly, most pregnant women in the United States consume less than the recommended amounts of vitamin D. An analysis of 2001–2014 NHANES data found that pregnant women age 20 to 40 years had a mean daily intake of vitamin D from foods of 5.5 mcg, and 92.1% of them were consuming less than the EAR for vitamin D [ 18 ].\nDietary supplements that contain vitamin D can help pregnant women reach the recommended intake of vitamin D and may be particularly useful for those who follow a vegan diet. However, many pregnant women still fall short. When total intakes, including dietary supplements, are considered, the mean daily intake of vitamin D in pregnant women in the United States increases to 11.3 mcg, and 46.4% of women fall below the EAR [ 18 ].\nThe UL for vitamin D during pregnancy is 100 mcg/day [ 4 ]. This is the same as the value for nonpregnant females age 14 to 50 years. Less than 0.5% of pregnant women age 20 to 40 years in the United States have total vitamin D intakes from foods and dietary supplements that exceed the UL, according to 2001–2014 NHANES data [ 18 ].\nVitamin D is crucial during pregnancy for proper fetal development, including for bone growth. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with several adverse pregnancy outcomes including congenital rickets and an increased risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and preterm birth [ 223-225 ]. However, the effects of vitamin D supplementation on pregnancy outcomes are mixed [ 223 ].\nA 2024 Cochrane Review included 10 trials in 3,867 women from Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Iran, New Zealand, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom that evaluated the effects of vitamin D supplements alone or in combination with other micronutrients during pregnancy [ 223 ]. It found the following:\nVitamin D supplementation alone reduced the risk of severe postpartum hemorrhage, but this was based on a low certainty of evidence. Vitamin D supplementation alone, vitamin D plus calcium, or vitamin D plus calcium and other vitamins and minerals did not reduce the risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, low birthweight, preterm birth, nephritic syndrome, or other adverse health outcomes, but these findings were based on low or very low certainty of evidence.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of 20 RCTs that included 1,682 pregnant women with gestational diabetes found that vitamin D supplementation improved maternal blood lipid concentrations and decreased the risk of preterm birth by 63%, the risk of hyperbilirubinemia by 62%, and the risk of neonatal hospitalization by 62% [ 226 ]. A meta-analysis of three RCTs found increased bone mineral density among children born to women who took vitamin D supplements during their pregnancies, but the authors call for further research to confirm these findings [ 227 ]. Another meta-analysis of four RCTs in 3,931 pregnant women found that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy did not affect the risk of congenital abnormalities in their children, such as congenital heart disease or NTDs [ 228 ].\nThe recommendations from professional societies, government agencies, and public health organizations on vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy differ somewhat. These recommendations are summarized in Table 12.\nMore information is available in the ODS fact sheet on vitamin D for health professionals .\n",
    "Zinc": "Zinc is important for fetal growth and development due to its widespread involvement in cellular metabolism. The RDA for zinc increases during pregnancy to 12 mg for ages 14 to 18 years and 11 mg for ages 19 to 50 years. About one-fifth (21.5%) of pregnant women in the United States have dietary zinc intakes that are below the EAR. Dietary supplements that contain zinc can help increase intakes to recommended amounts and may be particularly useful for people who follow vegetarian or vegan diets. However, the effects of zinc supplementation on pregnancy outcomes are unclear. The zinc UL during pregnancy is 34 mg/day for ages 14 to 18 years and 40 mg for ages 19 to 50 years.\nZinc is involved in many aspects of cellular metabolism. It is required for the catalytic activity of hundreds of enzymes, and it plays a role in enhancing immune function, protein and DNA synthesis, wound healing, and cell signaling and division [ 8 , 234-236 ]. Zinc also supports healthy growth and development of the fetus during pregnancy [ 234 , 235 , 237 ].\nThe RDA for zinc during pregnancy is 12 mg for ages 14 to 18 years and 11 mg for ages 19 to 50 [ 8 ]. These values are higher than those for nonpregnant females of 9 mg for ages 14 to 18 years and 8 mg for ages 31 to 50 years.\nGood sources of zinc include meat, fish, and seafood, especially oysters [ 235 ]. Dairy products and eggs also contain zinc. Beans, nuts, and whole grains contain zinc, but the bioavailability of zinc from these foods is lower than that from animal foods because these plant foods contain phytates that inhibit zinc absorption [ 238 ].\nZinc is available in many dietary supplements [ 12 ]. This includes most prenatal supplements; the authors of a 2021 evaluation of 188 prenatal supplements on the U.S. market reported that 89% of these products included zinc with a median amount of 15 mg/serving [ 30 ].\nZinc deficiency is common in low- and middle-income countries [ 234 ]. Most people in the United States consume adequate amounts of zinc, but some, including those who are pregnant, might have marginal intakes. People who follow vegetarian or vegan diets are particularly likely to have low zinc status [ 239 ]. According to 2001–2014 NHANES data, pregnant women age 20 to 40 years had a mean daily intake of 12.4 mg of zinc from foods, and 21.5% of them were consuming less than the EAR for zinc [ 18 ].\nDietary supplements that contain zinc can help pregnant women reach recommended amounts, especially those who follow a vegetarian or vegan diet. When total intakes, including dietary supplements, are considered, the mean daily zinc intake among pregnant women in the United States increases to 22.7 mg and the percentage of women who fall below the EAR decreases to 10.9% [ 18 ].\nThe UL for zinc during pregnancy is 34 mg/day for ages 14 to 18 years and 40 mg for ages 19 to 50 years [ 8 ]. These values are the same as those for nonpregnant females. When total zinc intakes from foods and dietary supplements are considered, 7.1% of pregnant women age 20 to 40 years in the United States exceed the zinc UL, according to 2001–2014 NHANES data [ 18 ].\nAdequate zinc status during pregnancy is important for fetal growth and development. Low serum zinc concentrations during pregnancy might increase the risk of gestational hypertension, low birthweight, and preterm birth [ 240-242 ]. However, the effects of zinc supplementation on pregnancy outcomes are unclear.\nA 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis included 13 studies that evaluated zinc supplementation during pregnancy in low- and middle-income countries [ 243 ]. The authors concluded that zinc supplementation may increase maternal serum zinc concentrations, but it does not affect the risk of preeclampsia or eclampsia, preterm birth, low birthweight, or small for gestational age.\nA 2021 Cochrane Review that included 25 RCTs in more than 18,000 women and their infants concluded that there is not enough evidence to determine whether zinc supplementation during pregnancy improves maternal or neonatal outcomes [ 242 ].\nThe 2020–2025 DGA recommends that pregnant women who follow vegetarian or vegan diets consult with a health care provider to determine whether zinc supplementation is necessary [ 17 ].\nWHO does not recommend zinc supplementation during pregnancy as part of routine care [ 244 ]. Currently, there are no other recommendations from professional societies, government agencies, or public health organizations for zinc supplementation during pregnancy.\nMore information is available in the ODS fact sheet on zinc for health professionals .\n",
    "Botanical Ingredients": "Botanical ingredients have been used in pregnancy for centuries. Some evidence supports the use of some botanicals during pregnancy, such as ginger for alleviating nausea [ 86 , 205 , 245 ], but most botanicals lack evidence of their safety and efficacy. This is due in part to limited research in pregnant women, given the delicate nature of this life stage. In addition, the high variability of botanical products in terms of their complexity, combination, and preparation complicates safety and efficacy assessments [ 246 ].\nBecause of potential safety concerns, caution is warranted when considering the use of any botanical supplement during pregnancy [ 247 , 248 ]. Nonetheless, 33% of nonprescription prenatal supplements and 6% of prescription prenatal supplements include a botanical ingredient [ 11 ]. For example, some prenatal supplements contain peppermint leaf or ginger root [ 12 ]. In addition, many pregnant women may be using botanical products without consulting with their health care providers [ 249 ].\n",
    "Caffeine from Botanical Sources": "Caffeine is naturally present in some botanicals, such as green tea, yerba mate, kola nut, and guarana. Consuming moderate amounts of caffeine during pregnancy does not appear to be a concern for healthy women, but high intakes could adversely affect fetal growth and other pregnancy outcomes.\nSome botanicals, such as green tea, yerba mate, kola nut, and guarana, contain caffeine. Caffeine is a stimulant that crosses the placenta during pregnancy, and high caffeine doses could adversely affect fetal growth and other pregnancy outcomes [ 10 , 250 ]. In addition, pregnancy can affect caffeine clearance from the body, substantially increasing its half-life. However, experts do not believe that moderate caffeine intake during pregnancy is a concern for healthy women.\nA 12-ounce cup of brewed coffee contains about 113 to 247 mg of caffeine, whereas green tea contains about 37 mg, and black tea contains about 71 mg [ 251 ]. Ascertaining the caffeine content of dietary supplements can be challenging because some supplements that contain botanical sources of caffeine do not declare the amount of caffeine on the product label.\nACOG states that moderate caffeine consumption during pregnancy (up to 200 mg/day) does not appear to increase the risk of miscarriage or preterm birth [ 252 ]. They note that whether caffeine increases the risk of intrauterine growth restriction is unclear.\nSimilarly, the 2020–2025 DGA states that low to moderate amounts of caffeine (up to about 300 mg/day) do not usually have adverse effects on the infant [ 17 ]. They add that women who are pregnant or who could be pregnant should consult their health care providers for advice about caffeine.\nOther experts agree that caffeine intakes up to 200 to 300 mg/day appear to be safe during pregnancy [ 10 , 250 , 253 , 254 ].\n",
    "German Chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla)": "German chamomile is promoted for alleviating nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. However, the evidence supporting its use is very limited, and its safety during pregnancy has not been well studied.\nGerman chamomile is an herb that belongs to the Asteraceae family. Dietary supplements made from the dried flower of German chamomile are promoted for alleviating nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, but the evidence is very limited:\nA 2015 Cochrane Review evaluated the use of German chamomile, among other interventions, for alleviating nausea and vomiting during early pregnancy [ 199 ]. The review included only one study that compared the effects of German chamomile (500 mg of the dried flower) to ginger and placebo; each intervention was administered twice daily for 1 week in pregnant women with nausea and vomiting. Compared with placebo, German chamomile reduced nausea and vomiting. However, the Cochrane authors noted that there is not enough high-quality evidence to recommend using German chamomile during pregnancy. WHO recommends using chamomile to relieve nausea in early pregnancy, but they note that this recommendation is based on low-certainty evidence [ 86 ].\nGerman chamomile, like other plants in the Asteraceae family, can cause allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis [ 255-257 ]. The safety of using German chamomile during pregnancy has not been well studied [ 258 ]. Another type of chamomile—Roman chamomile ( Chameamelum nobile )—may cause spontaneous abortion, so experts advise against its use during pregnancy [ 258 ].\n",
    "Ginger (Zingiber officinale)": "Ginger is promoted for alleviating nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. Some evidence suggests it may be helpful, mainly for nausea. Ginger appears to be safe to use during pregnancy.\nGinger rhizome (underground stem) is commonly used in foods and beverages. It is also available in dietary supplements, usually as powdered ginger or ginger extracts. Ginger is promoted for alleviating nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. Some evidence supports its use, mainly for alleviating nausea:\nA 2015 Cochrane Review evaluated the use of ginger, among other interventions, for alleviating nausea and vomiting during early pregnancy [ 199 ]. The review included 13 studies that examined the effects of ginger as syrup, capsules, or powder within biscuits. The doses of ginger used in the studies varied, but many studies used 1 g/day for several days to a few weeks. The authors concluded that ginger may be helpful, but the overall evidence was not consistent. A 2023 meta-analysis included 14 studies that examined the effects of ginger at doses ranging from 500 mg to 2.5 g/day for 4 days to 3 weeks [ 259 ]. It found that ginger can be helpful but that it was more effective for alleviating nausea than vomiting. However, the quality of evidence was low for most of the studies. A 2024 umbrella review of ginger use during pregnancy included seven meta-analyses (including the two described above) that covered 22 studies [ 260 ]. The studies evaluated the use of preparations of powdered ginger, ginger extracts, or brewed ginger. The authors reported that the majority of the meta-analyses found that ginger significantly improved nausea during pregnancy when compared with placebo. However, the quality of the meta-analyses included in the review was described as low to critically low. ACOG states that ginger can be considered as a nonpharmaceutical option for alleviating nausea during pregnancy based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence [ 205 ]. However, they add that ginger has not been shown to be effective for reducing vomiting. NICE states that there is some evidence that ginger helps treat mild-to-moderate nausea and vomiting during pregnancy [ 245 ]. They recommend that health care providers suggest trying ginger for patients who prefer nonpharmaceutical options. WHO recommends using ginger to relieve nausea in early pregnancy, but they note that this recommendation is based on low-certainty evidence [ 86 ].\nIn the United States, ginger is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for its intended use [ 261 ]. Ginger use during pregnancy appears to be safe. No adverse effects have been reported in people who use 1 to 2 g daily, although not all studies have assessed adverse effects [ 247 , 258 ].\n",
    "Peppermint (Mentha piperita)": "Peppermint leaf and peppermint leaf essential oil are promoted for alleviating nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. However, it is unclear whether they are helpful. The safety of using peppermint leaf during pregnancy has not been well studied, and experts advise against taking peppermint leaf essential oil.\nPeppermint leaf and peppermint leaf essential oil are promoted for alleviating nausea and vomiting during pregnancy [ 247 , 248 ]. Peppermint is often used as inhalation aromatherapy (which is not classified as a dietary supplement), rather than as an oral supplement [ 247 ]. However, it is unclear whether peppermint is helpful because the research on its effects is very limited.\nIn the United States, peppermint is GRAS for its intended use [ 261 ], and it is considered safe when consumed in the amounts that are commonly found in foods [ 262 ].\nLimited information is available on the safety of taking peppermint leaf during pregnancy [ 258 ]. According to experts, peppermint leaf essential oil should not be taken during pregnancy except under the supervision of a qualified health care practitioner [ 258 ].\n",
    "Red Raspberry Leaf (Rubus idaeus)": "Red raspberry leaf is promoted for strengthening the uterus and facilitating labor. However, the evidence supporting its use is very limited, and its safety during pregnancy has not been well studied.\nRed raspberry leaf is promoted for strengthening the uterus and facilitating labor, possibly because of its effects on muscle tissue in the uterus [ 248 , 263 , 264 ]. However, there is very little evidence supporting its use.\nA 2021 systematic review of red raspberry leaf use in pregnancy included 13 studies [ 263 ]. Six of the studies were in humans, but only one was an RCT. That study used 2.4 g/day raspberry leaf extract from 32 weeks gestation until the start of labor, and it did not find any differences compared with placebo for outcomes such as length of labor or mode of birth. The review authors concluded that the evidence supporting the use of red raspberry leaf during pregnancy is weak.\nThe safety of using red raspberry leaf during pregnancy has not been well studied, although doses up to 2.4 g/day from 32 weeks gestation until delivery have not been reported to cause adverse effects [ 258 ].\n",
    "Other Botanicals": "It is unclear whether other botanicals have beneficial effects during pregnancy. However, some botanicals may cause spontaneous abortion or other adverse effects.\nWhether other botanicals have beneficial effects on pregnancy outcomes has not been established. However, some botanicals may be unsafe to use during pregnancy. The following list provides some examples, but it is not an exhaustive list:\nSome botanicals, such as goldenseal, mugwort, and pennyroyal, may cause uterine contractions or spontaneous abortions [ 258 ]. Furthermore, using these botanicals to induce an abortion can cause serious side effects, including liver failure and death. Feverfew and licorice root may have adverse effects on the fetus [ 258 ]. Other botanicals, such a fenugreek, sassafras, black cohosh, blue cohosh, and ginkgo, may also be unsafe to use during pregnancy [ 247 , 258 , 265 ].\n",
    "Twin and Other Multiple Pregnancies": "The number of women giving birth to twins and other multiples is increasing. There are very few studies on nutritional needs for this population. While some general recommendations exist, the Food and Nutrition Board has not set separate Dietary Reference Intakes for women who are pregnant with twins or other multiples.\nIn the United States, about 3% of births are twins, while less than 0.1% are multiple births that consist of triplets or more [ 266 ]. The number of women giving birth to twins and other multiples in the United States has increased over the past several decades, primarily due to the use of assisted reproductive technology but also due to women giving birth at a more advanced age [ 267 , 268 ].\nA few studies have examined specific nutrients in women who are pregnant with multiples, but research is very limited. No formal nutrient recommendations exist for women who are pregnant with multiples.\nObservational studies that have compared biomarkers in women with single and twin pregnancies have reported lower concentrations of hemoglobin, serum vitamin D, and umbilical cord DHA in twin pregnancies [ 268-270 ]. Anemia due to folate deficiency is eight times more common in twin pregnancies than in single pregnancies [ 271 ]. One clinical trial found that high-dose folic acid (4–5.1 mg/day) did not reduce the risk of preeclampsia in women who were pregnant with twins compared with placebo [ 272 ]. The few clinical trials that have compared the effects of higher and lower doses of iron have had mixed results: One trial in women who did not have anemia and were carrying twins found that using a daily dose of 54 mg iron was no more effective than a daily dose of 27 mg at preventing iron deficiency anemia. In addition, more side effects were reported in the group that consumed the higher dose [ 273 ]. A trial in women with iron deficiency who were carrying twins found increases in hemoglobin and ferritin concentrations at 32 weeks in the group that took 68 mg/day iron compared with the group that took 34 mg/day. No other differences in neonatal outcomes or maternal reports of gastrointestinal complaints were found [ 274 ].\nOne trial in women who did not have anemia and were carrying twins found that using a daily dose of 54 mg iron was no more effective than a daily dose of 27 mg at preventing iron deficiency anemia. In addition, more side effects were reported in the group that consumed the higher dose [ 273 ]. A trial in women with iron deficiency who were carrying twins found increases in hemoglobin and ferritin concentrations at 32 weeks in the group that took 68 mg/day iron compared with the group that took 34 mg/day. No other differences in neonatal outcomes or maternal reports of gastrointestinal complaints were found [ 274 ].\nThe authors of a 2015 Cochrane Review were unable to draw conclusions about nutrition for multiple pregnancies due to a lack of evidence [ 275 ].\nFor multiple pregnancies, Alberta Health Services of Canada [ 254 ] recommends:\nFollowing the general nutrition guidelines for single pregnancies. Taking only one daily multivitamin supplement (i.e., not doubling the dose). Assessing whether additional calcium, vitamin D, and the omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA are needed.\nAlong with other experts [ 271 ], Alberta Health Services of Canada also recommends using higher amounts of folic acid (1,000 mcg/day) in women who are pregnant with multiples [ 254 ].\nExperts caution against using higher doses of vitamin A in women who are pregnant with twins or other multiples, because high doses can cause congenital birth defects. The vitamin A RDA does not increase for twin or other multiple pregnancies [ 254 , 268 ].\nThe FNB has not set separate DRIs for women who are pregnant with twins or other multiples.\n",
    "Vegetarian and Vegan Diets": "Nutritional intake among pregnant women who follow vegetarian or vegan diets varies widely depending on the type of dietary pattern they follow. Well-planned vegetarian and vegan diets can be nutritionally adequate during pregnancy. However, these diets are associated with lower levels of some nutrients, and dietary supplementation may be needed to meet the nutrient recommendations for pregnant women.\nMany people follow vegetarian and vegan diets, but few studies have evaluated the impact of these diets on maternal and infant health outcomes. Moreover, vegetarian dietary patterns differ. Vegan diets exclude all foods of animal origin, while vegetarian diets may include some animal-sourced food [ 276 ]. For example, lacto-vegetarian diets include dairy, while lacto-ovo vegetarian diets include dairy and eggs.\nOverall, limited research suggests that among pregnant women with adequate access to food (i.e., those who avoid animal-based foods by choice), pregnancy outcomes among women who follow vegetarian or vegan diets are similar to those in omnivores, as long as vitamin and mineral needs are met [ 149 , 277 ].\nSome evidence links vegetarian and vegan diets during pregnancy with a higher risk of infants born small for gestational age, but this has not been associated with postnatal morbidity. In addition, no associations have been reported between vegetarian or vegan diets and gestational diabetes, gestational anemia, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, or other maternal outcomes [ 277-279 ].\nFollowing a healthy vegetarian dietary pattern during pregnancy can meet most nutrient needs but meeting some micronutrient requirements can be challenging [ 280 ]. Studies show that people who follow vegetarian or vegan diets, including those who are pregnant, tend to have lower intakes of vitamin B12, vitamin D, iron, zinc, iodine, calcium, choline, and the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA [ 97 , 213 , 276 , 277 , 281 , 282 ]. However, it is important to keep in mind that nutrient intakes can differ according to the dietary pattern. For example, lacto-ovo vegetarian diets may contain adequate amounts of calcium while vegan diets may not [ 149 , 213 ].\nIn general, the recommendations for all pregnant women apply to those who adhere to vegetarian or vegan diets as well. There are currently only a few recommendations that specifically address supplementation in women who are pregnant and adhere to vegetarian or vegan diets.\nThe Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics states that well-planned vegetarian and vegan diets can be nutritionally adequate during pregnancy [ 149 ]. They also recommend the following:\nSpecial consideration for adequate intakes of iron, zinc, vitamin B12, and EPA and DHA during pregnancy (in addition to protein, calcium, iodine, and vitamin D) for all women who follow vegetarian or vegan diets. They note that vegan sources of EPA and DHA that are derived from microalgae are available as supplements. Vitamin B12 supplements or fortified foods, especially for women who follow vegan diets. Iron supplementation of 30 mg/day from a prenatal supplement, a separate iron supplement, or a combination of the two.\nThe 2020–2025 DGA states that a lacto-ovo vegetarian pattern is one of the recommended dietary patterns during pregnancy [ 17 ]. The DGA also notes the following:\nPregnant women who follow a vegetarian or vegan dietary pattern should consult with a health care provider to determine whether supplementation of iron; vitamin B12; and/or other nutrients such as choline, zinc, iodine, or EPA/DHA is necessary. If supplementation is necessary, the health care provider should determine the appropriate levels to meet the patient’s unique needs. Obtaining adequate amounts of iron may be a particular concern because plant foods contain only nonheme iron, which is less bioavailable than heme iron. Obtaining adequate amounts of vitamin B12 is a concern because this vitamin is present only in foods from animal sources.\nThe National Health Service in the United Kingdom has similar recommendations [ 283 ].\nSome professional societies have specific recommendations for pregnant women who follow vegan diets:\nACOG states that this population may require vitamin and mineral supplementation [ 14 ]. The American Thyroid Association recommends 150 mcg/day iodine supplementation for all pregnant women and states that those who follow vegan diets may need additional supplementation [ 124 , 284 ].\n",
    "Pregnancy After Bariatric Surgery": "The weight loss that occurs after bariatric surgery among women with obesity can improve pregnancy outcomes. However, bariatric surgery increases the risk of several micronutrient deficiencies, and dietary supplements can reduce deficiencies. The clinical practice guidelines from professional societies recommend supplementation with vitamins A, B12, D, E, K, thiamin, folic acid, calcium, copper, iron, and zinc in these women.\nNearly 40% of women of reproductive age in the United States have obesity, and more than half of all bariatric surgeries are performed in this population [ 285 , 286 ]. Sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and adjustable gastric band are the most common types of bariatric surgery.\nAlthough the weight loss that follows bariatric surgery can improve pregnancy outcomes, there are also increased risks of adverse health outcomes, including anemia, congenital abnormalities, preterm birth, low birthweight, and perinatal mortality [ 285 , 287-289 ].\nBariatric surgery also increases the risk of several micronutrient deficiencies. Pregnant women who have undergone bariatric surgery are commonly at higher risk of deficiencies in vitamins A, B12, D, and K; calcium; iron; and folate. However, the effects of surgery vary depending on the type of bariatric procedure [ 285 , 289-293 ]. For example, vitamin A undernutrition may be particularly severe in pregnant women following RYGB [ 294 ].\nDietary supplements can reduce micronutrient deficiencies and are commonly recommended for all people following bariatric surgery. However, experts note that standard multivitamins and prenatal supplements may not provide adequate amounts of nutrients, such as vitamin B12, iron, or fat-soluble vitamins, for people who have undergone bariatric surgery [ 286 , 290 ]. In addition, few guidelines are specific to pregnancy following bariatric surgery.\nThe 2019 Clinical Practice Guidelines from the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology, The Obesity Society, American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, Obesity Medicine Association, and American Society of Anesthesiologists recommend the following nutrient supplementation for all individuals after bariatric surgery to prevent deficiencies: vitamins A, B12, D, E, and K; thiamin; folic acid; calcium; copper; iron; and zinc [ 295 ].\nSome recommendations relate specifically to pregnancy after bariatric surgery [ 295 ]. Women should avoid getting pregnant for 12 to 18 months post procedure. In addition, health care providers should ensure that these patients receive:\nCounseling and monitoring for appropriate weight gain during pregnancy, nutritional supplementation, and fetal health. Screening for nutrient deficiencies every trimester, including vitamin B12, vitamin D, folate, iron, and calcium. Additional screening for other fat-soluble vitamins, zinc, and copper if they have had a malabsorptive procedure, such as RYGB.\nThe British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society has similar guidelines [ 296 ].\nThe 2009 ACOG practice guidelines for bariatric surgery and pregnancy recommend nutritional consultation after conception with consideration of a broad evaluation for micronutrient deficiencies [ 288 ].

    "Sickle Cell Disease": "Pregnant women with sickle cell disease are at risk for adverse maternal and infant health outcomes. For these women, the Society for Fetal-Maternal Medicine recommends daily supplementation with 4 mg folic acid and prenatal vitamins that do not contain iron, unless iron deficiency is confirmed.\nSickle cell disease (SCD; also known as sickle cell anemia) is a group of inherited blood disorders that are characterized by misshaped red blood cells [ 297 ]. It can cause pain due to blocked blood flow as well as stroke, lung and eye problems, infections, and kidney disease.\nIn the United States, about 100,000 people have SCD. Although more than 90% of people in the United States with SCD are Black and an estimated 3% to 9% are Hispanic or Latino, race should not be the only factor used to assess genetic risk [ 298 , 299 ].\nPregnant women with SCD have a significantly increased risk of adverse maternal and infant health outcomes, including death [ 297 , 299 , 300 ]. However, pre-pregnancy counseling and multidisciplinary care can improve outcomes.\nIn 2024, the Society for Fetal-Maternal Medicine released guidelines for SCD management during pregnancy [ 299 ]. It recommends the following for pregnant women who have SCD:\nMaternal baseline assessments of iron and iron stores and hematocrit. Maternal baseline assessment of vitamin D and, if needed, supplementation up to 1,000 to 2,000 IU/day (25–50 mcg/day). Supplementation with prenatal vitamins that do not contain iron unless iron deficiency is confirmed. Supplementation with 4 mg/day folic acid.\nACOG endorses these recommendations [ 301 ].\n",

    "Introduction": "Primary mitochondrial disorders (PMDs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by impaired mitochondrial structure or function due to mutations in nuclear or mitochondrial DNA [ 1 ]. PMDs are the most common inborn errors of metabolism and have a prevalence of approximately 1 in 5,000 individuals [ 1 , 2 ]. Diagnosis, treatment, and day-to- day management of these diseases remain challenging and costly [ 1 ].\nThe metabolic pathway most affected in PMDs is the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), which is the most important pathway for producing energy in the form of adenosine 5’-triphosphate (ATP) [ 3 ]. The ETC, found in the inner membrane of the mitochondria, consists of four protein complexes commonly referred to as complexes I, II, III, and IV, along with two mobile electron carriers (ubiquinone or coenzyme Q [CoQ] and cytochrome c) and the ATP synthase complex [ 4 ]. ETC dysfunction reduces ATP production, increases anaerobic metabolism (which can lead to elevated lactate concentrations in the blood [lactic acidosis] and/or cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]), and increases free radical production, which can lead to oxidative stress and additional cellular damage and dysfunction.\nTissues that have high energy requirements are the most affected in PMDs. These tissues include the central nervous system, peripheral nerves, eyes, ears, skeletal and cardiac muscles, kidneys, endocrine organs, and gastrointestinal tract. Patients typically present with multisystem or organ-specific disorders [ 4 , 5 ]. The clinical features of PMDs vary and have been reviewed elsewhere [ 5 , 6 ]. Central neurological features include encephalopathy, seizures, stroke-like episodes, dementia, ophthalmoplegia, and hearing deficits. Peripheral neurological features include myopathy (signs include fatigue and exercise intolerance), ataxia, and peripheral neuropathy [ 5 ].\nTo date, these disorders have no cures. However, clinicians use a variety of modalities to treat patients with PMDs, including prescription drugs, specialized diets, and exercise to provide symptomatic relief and slow the progression of clinical symptoms [ 5 , 7-10 ]. Consensus-based recommendations for standardized treatment and preventive health care of patients with PMDs have been published [ 11 ]. In addition, clinicians often prescribe one or more dietary supplements for these patients because of their potential beneficial effects on patient symptoms. Dietary supplements are designed to supplement the diet and, by law, may not be marketed to treat, mitigate, or cure diseases [ 12 ]. Nevertheless, clinicians can and do use them for these purposes [ 10 ], and patients also frequently manage their disease with these products [ 13 ].\nCertain dietary supplements may be of value in treating PMDs because, as nutrients and metabolic cofactors, they help increase mitochondrial ATP production, bypass a cellular defect (e.g., a deficiency in the activity of complexes I, II, or III in the ETC), or remove toxic metabolites [ 9 , 14 ].\nHowever, few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have assessed the effects of dietary supplements in PMDs, and studies have investigated the effects of only a few ingredients in dietary supplements singly or in combination in patients with PMDs [ 5 ]. Furthermore, much of the published positive evidence for dietary supplements to manage PMDs comes from studies with designs that do not demonstrate that the intervention studied was responsible for the observed health effects (e.g., case reports as well as retrospective and open-label studies) or from underpowered small clinical trials [ 10 , 15 , 16 ].\nEven when evidence from RCTs (which can demonstrate cause-effect relationships) is available to support the use of one or more dietary supplements to treat a PMD, the use of these products in patient care can be challenging. The reasons include the variability of study designs, dosing regimens, and duration of the interventions tested; differences in clinical and biochemical parameters assessed; small samples; and the clinical, biochemical, and genetic heterogeneity of these disorders [ 4 ]. In addition, recruitment of patients to clinical trials has been challenging because of the wide availability and use of certain supplements (e.g., CoQ 10 ) by patients with PMDs before joining the studies. Some patients are reluctant to join a study that might assign them to a placebo group and temporarily stop them from using the supplement, which they believe would jeopardize their clinical status [ 17 , 18 ].\nThis fact sheet summarizes published scientific trials, other studies, and reports in the English language on the use of dietary supplements to treat PMDs. The PMDs targeted by the studies that are discussed here are:\nChronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) Cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV in the ETC) deficiency Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS) Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) Leigh syndrome Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (MNGIE) Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF) Neurogenic weakness, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP)\n",

    "Arginine": "Arginine is a conditionally essential amino acid involved in many metabolic processes, including protein metabolism, creatine synthesis, and urea detoxification [ 33 ]. Arginine is also the precursor of NO, an important neurotransmitter and vasodilator. Arginine can be obtained from dietary protein sources, such as animal-based foods and nuts. It is endogenously synthesized from citrulline via argininosuccinate synthase and argininosuccinate lyase [ 33 , 34 ], and it is available as a dietary supplement [ 25 ].\nSome patients with PMDs have low concentrations of NO [ 33 ]. The causes of NO deficiency include decreased NO synthesis because of impaired endothelial function; sequestration of NO associated with increased activity of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV in the ETC); decreased levels of the NO precursors arginine and citrulline; and increased asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an NO synthase inhibitor involved in converting arginine to NO [ 33 ]. Because low NO availability might play a role in the pathogenesis of PMDs, arginine supplementation has been used to increase NO concentrations [ 33 ].\nArginine supplementation has been used in patients with MELAS because of NO’s role in stimulating vasodilation, which is believed to reduce the severity and frequency of stroke-like episodes [ 35 ]. However, no RCTs have tested this hypothesis, and evidence of arginine's efficacy in MELAS is based on small open-label studies (with 6 to 15 patients) for 12–24 months [ 35-39 ]. Moreover, no studies have assessed the use of arginine supplementation to treat other PMDs. A clinical trial is under way to determine the effects of arginine and citrulline supplementation on endothelial dysfunction in children with PMDs.\nThe evidence from open-label studies on the use of dietary supplements containing arginine indicates that they have potentially beneficial effects in patients with MELAS. Oral administration of 150 to 300 mg/kg/day arginine for 12–24 months significantly decreased the frequency and severity of stroke-like episodes. Patients did not have major stroke-like attacks, such as hemiconvulsions or hemiparesis (temporary muscle weakness on one side of the body), after arginine supplementation. However, headache and teichopsia (visual sensation of bright shimmering colors) persisted [ 37-39 ]. Moreover, oral arginine supplementation for 24 months improved endothelial function, as shown by an increase in flow-mediated vasodilation [ 38 , 39 ].\nThe evidence from intravenous arginine administration to manage symptoms associated with the acute phase (first few hours) of stroke-like episodes in patients with MELAS, in particular, also appears to be positive. Four studies in 3 to 24 patients showed that intravenous administration of 500 mg/kg arginine within 30 minutes of a stroke resulted in the improvement of all symptoms (e.g., headache, clinical disability, nausea, vomiting, and teichopsia), although teichopsia persisted in three patients [ 36-39 ]. In addition, intravenous arginine improved endothelial function, as shown by increased flow-mediated vasodilation 2 hours after arginine infusion [ 36 , 38 , 39 ].\nFurther research, including RCTs, is needed to assess the efficacy and safety of this dietary supplement in patients with MELAS. In addition, research on the effects of arginine supplementation in other PMDs is needed.\nMost study results suggest that up to 9 g/day arginine for several days or weeks is safe and well tolerated. At doses of 9–30 g/day, the most commonly reported adverse reactions are gastrointestinal discomfort, such as diarrhea and nausea, and slightly reduced blood pressure [ 40-42 ]. The safety of taking high-dose arginine supplements for more than 3 months is not known [ 42 ]. No adverse effects were reported from studies that administered arginine intravenously or orally in patients with MELAS [ 36 , 37 , 39 ]. However, overdoses of intravenous L-arginine-hydrochloride can lead to life-threatening hyperkalemia and hyponatremia [ 30 , 43-45 ].\n",

    "Citrulline": "Citrulline is a nonessential amino acid that the body produces primarily from glutamine. It can also be obtained from the diet; the best source is watermelon (365 mg citrulline in 1 cup diced seedless watermelon) [ 55 ]. Citrulline is also available as a dietary supplement.\nCitrulline serves as an intermediate in the urea cycle and as a precursor for arginine. Approximately 70% of the body’s citrulline is converted to arginine in the kidneys, accounting for 5%–15% of arginine produced in the body [ 33 ]. Arginine is the precursor of NO, an important neurotransmitter and vasodilator.\nSome patients with PMDs have low concentrations of NO [ 33 ]. The causes of NO deficiency in these patients can include decreased NO synthesis due to impairment of endothelial function, sequestration of NO associated with increased activity of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV in the ETC), decreased levels of NO precursors (arginine and citrulline), and increased levels of ADMA (an inhibitor of NO synthase involved in converting arginine to NO) [ 33 ].\nLow NO availability could play a role in PMD pathogenesis, and citrulline supplementation can increase arginine and NO concentrations. For this reason, some experts have suggested using it as a therapy for PMDs [ 33 , 34 , 56 ]. NO plays a role in stimulating vasodilation, which is believed to reduce the neurological consequences of stroke-like episodes in patients with MELAS [ 35 ].\nCitrulline supplementation increased NO production more efficiently than arginine in two small studies in patients with MELAS [ 33 , 34 , 56 ], but its effects on clinical outcomes in these patients or patients with other PMDs have not been evaluated. A clinical trial is under way to determine the effects of arginine and citrulline supplementation on endothelial dysfunction in children with mitochondrial diseases.\nTwo studies compared the effects of citrulline and arginine administration on NO production in a total of 10 adults and five children with MELAS [ 34 , 56 ]. Using stable isotope infusion protocols, the authors assessed NO production rate, citrulline and arginine fluxes, and de novo synthesis of arginine before and after citrulline or arginine supplementation. Oral doses were 10 g/m 2 body surface area/day (administered in divided doses every 4 hours for 48 hours) in adults [ 34 ], 10 g/m 2 body surface area/day for children weighing 20 kg or more, and 500 mg/kg for those weighing less than 20 kg (administered in divided doses every 4 hours for 48 hours) [ 56 ]. Supplementation with citrulline increased plasma arginine levels, fluxes of arginine and citrulline, rates of de novo synthesis of arginine, and production of NO more than arginine supplementation. These studies did not assess any clinical outcomes.\nAdditional research is needed, including RCTs and studies with larger samples, to determine the efficacy and safety of citrulline supplementation and its effects on clinical outcomes on patients with PMDs.\nThe safety of citrulline, particularly when it taken in supplemental form for months at a time, has not been well studied. Stomach discomfort has been reported with 8 g citrulline malate (citrulline combined with malic acid) [ 57 ]. Short-term studies of up to 6 g/day citrulline for 4 weeks and 1.35 g/day for 6 weeks found no adverse effects [ 58 ].\n",
    "Creatine": "Creatine is naturally produced in the liver and kidneys from the amino acids glycine and arginine. It can also be obtained from the diet (meat and fish are the primary sources [ 59 ]) and from dietary supplements, which most commonly contain creatine monohydrate. High concentrations of creatine are present in tissues with high energy demands, including skeletal muscle and brain [ 30 ]. In tissue, creatine combines with phosphate to form PCr. PCr breakdown regenerates ATP in a reaction that transfers a phosphate to ADP, a source of energy released during anaerobic metabolism [ 30 ].\nPatients with mitochondrial myopathies can have low PCr levels in skeletal muscle, and patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathies might have low creatine levels in the brain [ 30 ]. The goal of creatine administration in these patients is to increase creatine concentrations in tissues and the ability of tissues to store PCr, creating a supply of energy in the form of ATP. In healthy individuals, total creatine and PCr levels can increase by 20% in skeletal muscle after daily doses of 10–20 g creatine for 4–6 days [ 81 , 82 ].\nThe effects of creatine supplementation in patients with PMDs have been investigated in small open-label studies and randomized, double-blind, crossover trials with conflicting results [ 83-86 ]. The effects of creatine in combination with other dietary supplements are described in the combination therapies section.\nTwo prospective studies found that creatine supplements had positive effects on muscular symptoms in patients with PMDs. The first—a randomized, double-blind, crossover study— provided creatine monohydrate for 3 weeks (5 g twice a day for 2 weeks, then 2 g twice a day for 1 week) or placebo for 3 weeks, with a 5-week washout period in between, to seven patients with MELAS or mitochondrial myopathy [ 84 ]. Supplementation resulted in a significant increase in ischemic isometric hand grip strength and an overall 11% increase in nonischemic, isometric, dorsiflexion torque compared with placebo. The second, an open-label study, assessed the effects of 0.08 to 0.35 g/kg/day creatine monohydrate supplementation for 9 months to approximately 4 years in five patients (7 to 19 years of age) with KSS, MELAS, or NARP [ 83 ]. Skeletal muscle power analyses showed a 12% average increase in maximal muscle performance in all patients. Self-reported muscular symptoms and coordination improved, but cognitive function (i.e., school performance) did not change.\nTwo randomized, controlled crossover trials found that creatine supplementation (150 mg/kg/day or 20 g/day) or placebo for 4–6 weeks, with a 4-week washout period in between, had no effect on clinical outcomes, such as skeletal muscular function, muscle or hand grip strength, endurance performance, or fatigue in a total of 31 patients with CPEO, KSS, or mitochondrial myopathy [ 85 , 86 ].\nIn summary, the studies of creatine supplementation in patients with PMDs have had conflicting results. Further research is needed to clarify the role of creatine in managing PMDs.\nNo adverse effects have been reported in patients with PMDs after oral supplementation with up to 20 g/day creatine monohydrate for up to 6 weeks [ 84-86 ]. Creatine is generally considered safe for short-term use (5 days) by healthy adults at up to 20 g/day and up to 3 g/day for maintenance doses [ 87 ]. However, the safety of creatine supplementation in children and adolescents is not well established [ 87 ]. Creatine supplementation can increase water retention and might stimulate muscle protein synthesis, resulting in weight gain [ 88 ]. Anecdotal reports have also associated creatine supplementation with muscle cramping, spasm, strains, and gastrointestinal distress [ 88 ].\n",

    "Dietary Supplements Commonly Used for Primary Mitochondrial Disorder Therapy": "The most commonly used dietary supplement ingredients for PMDs include antioxidants, such as vitamin C, vitamin E, and alpha-lipoic acid; electron donors and acceptors, such as CoQ 10 and riboflavin; compounds that can be used as alternative energy sources, such as creatine [ 14 ]; and compounds that can conjugate or bind mitochondrial toxins, such as carnitine [ 10 ].\nSome mitochondrial disorder specialists begin treating PMDs with one ingredient, whereas others use several ingredients together because of their potentially synergistic effects [ 19 ]. A combination of three to six compounds is generically referred to as a mitochondrial cocktail [ 12 ]. However, there is large variation in the composition of combination products and dosages, and there is no standardization among them [ 12 ]; thus, the commonly used term mitochondrial cocktail is nonspecific and nondescriptive. According to one survey, when more than three compounds are recommended to be taken together, most physicians use a compounding pharmacy [ 19 ].\nTables 1 and 2 summarize information on the proposed mechanisms of action, efficacy, and safety of the dietary supplement ingredients that are most commonly used for PMDs. These ingredients and combinations are listed in the tables in alphabetical order, and the information on their safety comes from assessments in healthy people, people with PMDs, or people with other conditions. References to support statements in Tables 1 and 2 are provided in the subsequent text.\nThe sections below discuss each of the ingredients, in alphabetical order, that studies have used as monotherapy to manage PMDs (summarized in Table 1). A subsequent section describes the evidence on combinations of ingredients used to manage PMDs (summarized in Table 2).\nTo capture all of the research that is pertinent to PMDs, this fact sheet is not limited to studies of dietary supplements that meet the regulatory definition (i.e., a dietary ingredient taken orally). Rather, this fact sheet also includes studies that administered dietary supplement ingredients intravenously or as prescription or nonprescription drugs.\n",
    "Alpha-Lipoic Acid": "ALA, also known as lipoic acid or thioctic acid, is naturally present in the mitochondria. ALA serves as a cofactor for enzymes that participate in intermediary cell metabolism that leads to ATP production. In addition, ALA and its reduced form, dihydrolipoic acid, can act as antioxidants by scavenging reactive oxygen species and helping regenerate other antioxidants, such as vitamin C, vitamin E, and glutathione [ 22 ]. Although the body makes sufficient amounts of ALA for basic metabolic functions (e.g., energy metabolism), it can only act as an antioxidant when it is present in greater amounts [ 22 , 23 ].\nALA is endogenously synthesized in mitochondria from octanoic acid [ 23 ]. It is also present in small amounts in foods, such as meats, liver, fruits, and vegetables [ 23 ], and it is available as dietary supplement. In dietary supplements, ALA is typically a mixture of R-ALA (natural, biologically active form) and S-ALA (manufactured form) enantiomers, but some products contain only R-ALA [ 24 ]. Typical amounts in dietary supplements range from 50 to 600 mg ALA [ 25 ].\nALA absorption and bioavailability have been studied using the amounts typically present in oral supplements. Pharmacokinetic studies have suggested that only 20% to 40% of an oral dose of a 50/50 mixture of R-ALA and S-ALA is absorbed [ 26 ]. Concentrations of R-ALA are 40% to 50% higher than S-ALA levels in plasma after ALA supplementation, suggesting that the R-ALA form is better absorbed and more bioavailable [ 27 ].\nIn patients with PMDs, ALA supplementation is used because of its potential to reduce oxidative stress [ 9 , 28 ] and to improve mitochondrial function [ 29 ].\nThe potential value of ALA in treating PMDs is based on limited evidence [ 29 ]. Scientific support comes from one case report of ALA supplementation alone (described below) and one clinical trial of ALA combined with creatine and CoQ 10 in 18 patients (described in the combination therapies section) [ 28 ].\nThe case report, published in 1995, described the effects of 1 month of oral ALA supplementation (200 mg three times daily) on energy metabolism in the brain and skeletal muscle of a patient with CPEO [ 29 ]. After 1 month, energy availability in the brain increased, as shown by a 55% increase in brain phosphocreatine (PCr), 72% increase in brain phosphorylation potential, and decrease in calculated brain adenosine diphosphate (ADP) concentration, suggesting improved mitochondrial function. Further improvement was reported after 7 months of supplementation. Supplementation also had a positive effect on muscle mitochondrial activity during exercise. Moreover, the patient reported general improvement characterized by decreases in pain and discomfort of the eyes and improved muscle strength after supplementation.\nIn a consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of PMDs, the Mitochondrial Medicine Society (MMS) recommends offering ALA supplementation to patients with PMDs even though no controlled clinical trials have evaluated its use as monotherapy in these patients [ 1 ]. The standard doses are 50 to 200 mg/day [ 30 ].\nNo safety issues were documented in the case report discussed above or the small clinical trial with 600 mg/day ALA [ 28 , 29 ]. Oral supplementation with 600 mg/day ALA for 6 months to 4 years was well tolerated in clinical trials of 233–509 people with diabetic polyneuropathy [ 31 , 32 ]. More studies are needed to address the safety of oral ALA supplementation in patients with PMDs.\n",
    "Carnitine": "Carnitine can be synthesized endogenously from the amino acids lysine and methionine in the liver and kidneys. It can also be obtained from the diet; red meat, chicken, fish, and dairy products are the primary sources [ 9 , 46 ]. Carnitine is available as a dietary supplement in the forms of L-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine, and propionyl-L-carnitine. It is also available as a prescription drug (Carnitor) that is used to treat primary carnitine-deficiency syndromes (e.g., defective carnitine synthesis) and some secondary ones.\nThe body maintains carnitine homeostasis by absorption from dietary sources, endogenous synthesis, and reabsorption in the kidneys [ 46 ]. Most of the body’s carnitine is in skeletal muscle (90%), whereas blood contains 0.5% [ 9 , 46 ]. The carnitine pool comprises free (nonesterified) carnitine and carnitine esters (acylcarnitines).\nCarnitine plays an important role in energy metabolism by transferring long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria for β-oxidation. It also facilitates the oxidation of pyruvate and branched-chain amino acids, and it helps remove toxic acetyl coenzyme A metabolites by binding to them for excretion in the urine [ 9 , 46 , 47 ].\nSome patients with mitochondrial myopathies have low levels of carnitine in plasma and skeletal muscle, although carnitine deficiency only occurs in the muscle in some patients [ 9 , 47 , 48 ].The low carnitine levels in these patients appear to be secondary to impaired mitochondrial function [ 9 , 47 ].\nPatients with PMDs use carnitine supplements to increase carnitine levels and support the elimination of toxic acyl compounds [ 30 ].\nCarnitine is used to manage PMDs, although its efficacy alone or in combination with other dietary supplements has only been investigated in a few small studies [ 9 ]. The effects of carnitine in combination with other dietary supplements are described in the combination therapies section.\nA small, randomized, double-blind, controlled, crossover study evaluated the effects of 3 g/day oral carnitine supplementation on exercise tolerance in 12 patients with mitochondrial myopathy and CPEO. Patients were studied after 8 weeks of carnitine treatment and 8 weeks of placebo treatment separated by a 4-week washout period [ 49 ]. No change was found after carnitine supplementation or placebo in peripheral muscle strength, which was initially lower compared to values of healthy controls. However, inspiratory capacity (a measure of lung function) and aerobic exercise performance during intense constant-work exercise improved significantly after carnitine supplementation compared with placebo. Because the study did not measure plasma or muscle carnitine concentrations, whether the patients had carnitine deficiency is not known.\nAn open-label study evaluated the effects of carnitine supplementation (50–200 mg/kg/day in two to four oral doses) for 1–24 months in 21 patients with CPEO, KSS, MELAS, mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, mitochondrial myopathy, or Leigh’s disease who had carnitine insufficiency [ 47 ]. Carnitine supplementation resulted in the normalization of plasma carnitine levels in all patients after 10 days and in the improvement of symptoms in 20 patients. Muscle tone and strength improved subjectively in 19 of 20 patients with muscle weakness. Growth improved after supplementation in four of eight patients with failure to thrive, and clinical and laboratory evaluation showed improvement in eight patients with cardiomyopathy based on echocardiographic evaluation. Ten percent of patients experienced side effects, mainly nausea and diarrhea.\nAdditional research is needed to reproduce the findings of these two studies and to clarify the role of carnitine supplementation in patients with other PMDs. The MMS recommends using carnitine supplementation only in patients with PMDs who have a documented carnitine deficiency, and it advises that clinicians monitor blood concentrations during therapy [ 1 ]. According to the MMS, the standard doses of carnitine for children are 20 to 100 mg/kg/day divided into two or three doses, and 330 to 990 mg/dose for adults two or three times per day; 3 g/day is the usual maximum [ 30 ].\nThe authors of a review of evidence on the safety of oral carnitine supplementation concluded, based on clinical studies of the supplement’s use for weight loss and energy balance, that carnitine intakes below 2,000 mg/day appear to be safe [ 50 ]. However, the evidence is insufficient to ascertain carnitine’s long-term safety [ 50 ]. A study in patients with organic acidemias indicated that carnitine supplementation (approximately 100 mg/kg) results in significant elevations of plasma trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) despite dietary meat restrictions [ 51 ]. This compound has been linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease [ 52 ]. However, the implications of these findings are not well understood and require more research.\nAt doses of approximately 3 g/day, carnitine supplements can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and a fishy body odor [ 53 , 54 ].\nFor more information about carnitine as a dietary supplement see the Carnitine fact sheet from the Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) of the National Institutes of Health.\nSome medications (e.g., cyclosporine, pivampicillin, and valproate) can decrease carnitine concentrations by forming compounds that are excreted in the urine [ 46 ]. In addition, the anticancer drugs etoposide, actinomycin D, and vinblastine; omeprazole for gastroesophageal reflux disease; and the antibiotic levofloxacin impair carnitine transport across the plasma membrane, which can result in secondary carnitine deficiency [ 46 ].\n",
    "Coenzyme Q10": "CoQ 10 is a fat-soluble quinone that transfers electrons in the ETC from complex I and II to complex III as part of the ATP production process [ 59 ]. CoQ 10 also acts as an antioxidant in its reduced form, ubiquinol, by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and protecting mitochondria and DNA from oxidative damage [ 9 , 60 , 61 ].\nHumans synthesize CoQ 10 endogenously. They can also obtain CoQ 10 from foods, including fish, meats, and whole grains, and from dietary supplements. CoQ 10 supplements are available in a variety of forms, including powder-filled, hard-shell capsules; oil-based suspensions; and emulsions in soft-gel capsules [ 9 ].\nCoQ 10 is insoluble in water, and powder formulations have lower intestinal absorption rates [ 30 , 62 , 63 ]. Ubiquinol is three to five times more bioavailable than the oxidized form, ubiquinone, making it a preferred form for supplementation [ 30 ]. Absorption of CoQ 10 improves when it is taken with meals or dietary fat [ 63 , 64 ].\nCoQ 10 supplementation is used in patients with PMDs because of its roles as a cofactor in the ETC and as an antioxidant.\nThe efficacy of CoQ 10 in PMDs, other than to treat primary CoQ 10 deficiency, still needs to be determined. In case reports, patients with primary CoQ 10 deficiency had positive responses to CoQ 10 , such as increased strength and reduced ataxia [ 65 , 66 ]. However, the evidence of CoQ 10 efficacy in other PMDs is limited. The efficacy of CoQ 10 used in combination with other dietary supplements is discussed in the combination therapies section.\nEffects of CoQ 10 supplementation have been explored in various studies that measured functional outcomes (e.g., exercise capacity or muscle strength) and/or biochemical parameters, such as plasma or serum lactate levels in patients at rest and during and after exercise; lactate to pyruvate (L/P) ratio; markers of oxidative stress; mitochondrial enzyme activity; and the PCr/inorganic phosphate [Pi] ratio, a marker of muscular function. However, studies used inconsistent measures, making comparisons of their findings difficult.\nFour of five small prospective studies in 8–30 patients with a variety of PMDs showed that doses of 150–1,200 mg or 2 mg/kg/day CoQ 10 for 2–6 months reduced plasma lactate concentrations [ 67-69 ] and the L/P ratio [ 70 ] after but not during exercise; supplementation also increased muscle strength [ 68 , 69 ]. The fifth study found no change in serum lactate before and after exercise but did show improvements in muscular function in one patient after supplementation [ 71 ].\nThe first prospective study, a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, evaluated the effects of CoQ 10 supplementation in 30 participants with PMDs, including MELAS, CPEO, mitochondrial myopathy, NARP, ataxia-neuropathy, and LHON [ 67 ]. Each patient received 1,200 mg/day CoQ 10 for 60 days and placebo for 60 days, with a 60-day washout period in between. A more than fivefold increase in plasma CoQ 10 concentration was reported after supplementation. Supplementation had no effect on biochemical parameters, including resting plasma lactate levels and urinary markers of oxidative stress. However, postexercise plasma lactate concentrations were lower after CoQ 10 administration. Supplementation with CoQ 10 did not affect muscle strength.\nThe second prospective study, a short-term crossover study, administered 160 mg/day CoQ 10 for 3 months and placebo for 1 month after a 4-week washout period in eight patients with MERRF, MELAS, or CPEO [ 68 ]. After 2 months, serum CoQ 10 concentrations increased significantly, but they did not increase further after another month. Supplementation with CoQ 10 did not significantly change serum lactate or pyruvate concentrations during exercise. Overall muscle strength increased significantly during CoQ 10 supplementation, but proximal and distal muscles of the upper and lower limbs showed no changes.\nThe third prospective study, which had two phases, assessed the effects of CoQ 10 supplementation in patients with a variety of PMDs [ 69 ]. In the first phase, 44 patients with KSS features, KSS, CPEO, mitochondrial myopathy without ophthalmoplegia, or MERRF received 2 mg/kg/day a form of CoQ 10 known as ubidecarenone in an open- label trial for 6 months [ 69 ]. Supplementation with CoQ 10 significantly decreased mean serum lactate levels after exercise, significantly increased the activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes (succinate dehydrogenase and succinate cytochrome c reductase) in muscle, reduced citrate synthase levels, and significantly increased muscle strength. Sixteen patients (36%) with at least a 25% decrease in postexercise serum lactate levels participated in the second, double-blinded phase, in which eight patients continued to receive 2 mg/kg/day CoQ 10 and eight received a placebo. This phase of the study was stopped after 3 months because two patients in the placebo group reported subjective worsening of their condition. Postexercise serum lactate concentrations did not decrease further after the 3 months of supplementation in either group, and there were no significant changes in the other parameters measured.\nThe fourth prospective study, a small open-label study, assessed clinically valuable metabolic parameters in patients with PMDs. The results showed a decreased L/P ratio after exercise after 150 mg/day CoQ 10 for 6 months in nine patients with ophthalmoplegia plus syndrome, CPEO, or KSS [ 70 ]. Compared with lactate alone, the L/P ratio was more sensitive for detecting metabolic changes in these patients. The authors did not report on clinical outcomes.\nThe final prospective study, an open-label study, investigated the effects of 150 mg/day CoQ 10 for 6 months on muscular function in eight patients with CPEO or mitochondrial encephalomyopathy at rest and during and after exercise [ 71 ]. The results showed a nonsignificant improvement in muscular function in only one patient, as shown by an increase in the PCr/Pi ratio after 3 months of supplementation, but this value returned to its pretreatment level at 6 months. Accelerated energy repletion was sustained after 6 months. However, the metabolic improvement did not result in a positive effect on exercise performance.\nSeveral case reports on CoQ 10 supplementation for PMDs were published between 1987 and 1999 [ 72-77 ]. Improvements in biochemical parameters (e.g., serum lactate) and reduced muscle weakness after CoQ 10 supplementation were reported in patients with a variety of PMDs. One case report also described an improvement in neurologic function after 120 mg/day CoQ 10 supplementation for 1 year in four patients with mitochondrial myopathy and three with KSS [ 77 ].\nIn summary, case reports and small open trials suggest that CoQ 10 supplementation improves biochemical parameters but provide little or no evidence of improved clinical outcomes in patients with PMDs. In addition, RCTs have found no beneficial effect in these patients. Additional research is needed to clarify the role of CoQ 10 in managing these disorders.\nIn its consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of PMDs, the MMS determined that the evidence supporting the use of CoQ 10 in PMDs is sparse, but it recommends offering CoQ 10 supplements to most patients with a PMD [ 1 ]. According to the MMS, the standard dose is 2–8 mg/kg/day ubiquinol (administered twice a day with meals) [ 30 ]. Doses of 5–30 mg/kg/day (administered in two divided doses with meals) are a recommended alternative [ 30 ]. The MMS also recommends using ubiquinol and monitoring absorption and adherence to treatment by measuring plasma and/or leukocyte CoQ 10 levels.\nClinical studies have shown that CoQ 10 is safe and well tolerated at up to 900 mg/day for 4 weeks in healthy volunteers [ 78 , 79 ] or at 600–3,000 mg/day in patients with various disorders (e.g., Huntington’s disease or Parkinson’s disease) [ 63 , 80 ]. Mild side effects include hyperactivity, insomnia, rash, gastrointestinal symptoms, nausea, and stomach upset [ 63 ].\nFor more information about CoQ 10 dietary supplements, see Coenzyme Q 10 .\nCertain medications decrease the endogenous synthesis of CoQ 10 . For example, cholesterol-lowering drugs, such as statins, might inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, resulting in a decrease in mevalonic acid, the precursor of cholesterol and CoQ 10 [ 63 ]. A meta-analysis of six randomized clinical trials showed a significant reduction in plasma CoQ 10 concentrations after statin treatment that was independent of dose and duration [ 142 ]. Antihypertensive drugs (e.g., the beta blockers propranolol and metoprolol) and oral hypoglycemic drugs (e.g., glyburide and tolazamide) might inhibit CoQ 10 -dependent enzymes [ 63 ]. Amitriptyline, a commonly prescribed antidepressant, can induce CoQ 10 deficiency in patients with depressive episodes [ 143 ]. CoQ 10 can also interfere with the effectiveness of warfarin [ 144 , 145 ].\n",
    "Folinic Acid": "Folate is the generic term for a family of compounds that act as coenzymes in the folate cycle, which plays an important role in DNA and RNA synthesis, creatine synthesis, and homocysteine remethylation. Folate also provides S-adenosylmethionine, the major methyl donor for methylation reactions [ 89 ].\nFolate is naturally present in a variety of forms and as the fully oxidized synthetic form, folic acid. Folic acid is the most commonly used form in dietary supplements and fortified foods. Other forms of folate in dietary supplements include L-methylfolate, 5-MTHF, and folinic acid (also known as 5-formyltetrahydrofolate) [ 25 , 90 ]. Prescription drug forms of L-methylfolate (deplin) and folinic acid (leucovorin) are also available.\nFolic acid must be reduced by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) to tetrahydrofolate and then to the biologically active form 5-MTHF by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase. In contrast, folinic acid is an immediate precursor of 5-MTHF and does not require these reduction steps to enter the folate cycle. For this reason, folinic acid and 5-MTHF supplements have been proposed as good alternatives to folic acid supplements when folate metabolism is impaired by medications, such as DHFR inhibitors (e.g., methotrexate, aminopterin, pyrimethamine, and trimethoprim), and/or alterations in the DHFR gene [ 90 ].\nFolinic acid increases brain concentrations of 5-MTHF in patients with primary or secondary CFD. CFD is associated with several PMDs, including KSS, pathogenic POLG variants, NARP, and Leigh syndrome [ 90 , 91 ]. CFD is known as cerebrospinal fluid 5-MTHF deficiency in people with normal peripheral folate status [ 90 ].\nThe exact mechanism of CFD in PMDs is still unclear. It has been suggested that patients with KSS have CFD, possibly because they have inadequate amounts of ATP, which is necessary for the active transport of folate across the blood-brain barrier into the brain [ 90 , 92 , 93 ]. Low cerebral folate levels can affect the methylation and stability of myelin. Consequently, myelin instability can result in white matter lesions that are common in patients with KSS [ 90 ].\nFolinic acid is available in dietary supplements alone or in combination with other vitamins, such as calcium folinate, in doses ranging from 400 to 1,000 mcg [ 25 , 90 ].\nLimited evidence suggests that folinic acid might reverse white matter abnormalities in patients with KSS [ 91 , 94 ]. For example, a small open-label study assessed the effects of folinic acid supplementation in six patients with KSS who had cerebral 5-MTHF deficiency; follow-up periods ranged from 1 to 8 years [ 91 ]. After therapy, cerebral 5-MTHF concentrations normalized in three patients (two receiving 1 mg/kg/day and one receiving 3 mg/kg/day). The patients who received 3 mg/kg/day folinic acid showed improvements in neurological symptoms, such as ataxia (abnormal, uncoordinated movements) and tremor (involuntary, rhythmic, oscillatory movement of a body part), although the disease progressed in all patients. In addition, one of the patients who received 3 mg/kg/day folinic acid also showed improvement in white matter abnormalities, but these abnormalities progressed in the other patients.\nIn a case report, 2.5 mg/kg/day folinic acid normalized CSF 5-MTHF concentrations and improved white matter myelinization in a patient with a form of KSS, but it had no effect on cerebellar ataxia or areflexia (absence of reflexes) [ 94 ].\nThe effects of folinic acid in combination with other dietary supplements are described in the combination therapies section.\nThe MMS recommends that clinicians consider folinic acid supplementation for patients with PMDs and central nervous system manifestations and that they routinely administer this supplement to patients with documented CFD or PMDs known to be associated with folate deficiency [ 1 ]. According to the MMS, the standard doses of folinic acid are 0.5 to 2.5 mg/kg once or twice a day for children and 2.5 to 25 mg once or twice a day for adults [ 30 ].\nIn summary, folinic acid in patients with cerebral 5-MTHF deficiency appears to be beneficial, but this evidence comes from just two case reports and a small open-label study in patients with KSS. Further research is needed to replicate these findings in larger samples and clarify the role of folinic acid supplementation in patients with PMDs.\nNo adverse effects were reported in patients with KSS after supplementation with 1 mg/kg/day or 3 mg/kg/day folinic acid for 1 to 8 years [ 91 ]. Hypersensitivity to folinic acid as leucovorin includes anaphylactoid and urticarial reactions [ 95 ].\n",
    "Niacin": "Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is a precursor of the coenzymes NAD and NAD phosphate (NADP), which are involved in many biological redox reactions. NAD and its reduced form NADH play an important role in energy metabolism by transferring electrons from intermediates to complex I in the mitochondrial ETC. NADP serves as a hydrogen donor in fatty acid and steroid synthesis and as a coenzyme for pentose synthesis via the pentose phosphate pathway. Niacin also has antioxidant properties and prevents oxidative stress [ 96 , 97 ].\nNiacin is endogenously produced in the body from the amino acid tryptophan and obtained from the diet from such foods as meats, grains, milk, and eggs [ 97 ]. Niacin is also available as a dietary supplement in the forms of nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, and inositol hexaniacinate. The amounts in supplements range from 50 to 1,000 mg [ 25 ]. Prescription drug forms, such as Niaspan (also available as generic niacin extended release), which contains 500 to 1,000 mg niacin, are also available [ 98 ].\nThe rationale for niacin supplementation in patients with PMDs is to increase NAD and NADH concentrations in cells and thus enhance substrate availability for complex I in the mitochondrial ETC for energy production [ 9 ].\nThe only evidence on the effects of niacin supplementation alone in patients with PMDs comes from a single case report published in 1996. In this report, a patient with MELAS who had decreased complex I activity and the typical m.3243A>G mutation was treated after the first stroke-like episode with 4,000 mg/day nicotinamide in four divided doses for 5 months [ 99 ]. Blood NAD concentrations were 24 times higher than pretreatment levels after 6 weeks of supplementation. Blood lactate levels dropped by 40%, and blood pyruvate concentrations declined by 50% on the third day of supplementation; blood lactate levels continued to decline until they approached the normal reference range (1.0–1.8 mmol/l) at 1 month. At 2 weeks, 24-hour urinary lactate levels declined by 50%. However, the patient showed progressive deterioration and died 5 months after treatment began.\nThe effects of niacin in combination with other dietary supplements are described in the combination therapies section.\nIn summary, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of niacin supplementation in PMDs. Additional research is needed, including studies with larger samples and RCTs, to determine the efficacy and safety of niacin supplementation in patients with PMDs.\nFlushing is a common side effect in people treated with 30 mg/day or more nicotinic acid by mouth and is characterized by a burning, tingling, and itching sensation primarily on the face, arms, and chest that can be accompanied by pruritus, headaches, and increased intracranial blood flow [ 97 ]. Nicotinamide and inositol hexanicotinate do not appear to be associated with flushing [ 97 , 100 ]. The Food and Nutrition Board established a tolerable upper intake level (UL) for niacin of 10 mg for age 1–3 years, 15 mg for age 4–8 years, 20 mg for age 9–13 years, 30 mg for age 14–18 years, and 35 mg for age 19 years and up [ 97 ]. These levels, however, apply to the general population and do not apply to individuals receiving niacin under medical supervision. Niacin ULs for infants have not been established.\nSome adverse effects have been reported with nicotinamide intakes of 3,000 mg/day, including nausea, vomiting, and signs and symptoms of liver toxicity [ 97 ]. In numerous case reports, patients given 3,000–9,000 mg/day niacin for months to years to treat hyperlipidemia developed liver toxicity [ 97 ]. Medical supervision should be provided for patients using more than 1,000 mg/day nicotinic acid [ 100 ].\nFor more information about niacin as a dietary supplement, see Niacin .\nAspirin reduces the flushing associated with niacin supplementation [ 147-150 ]. Niacin might elevate plasma glucose concentrations, which could be dangerous for people with diabetes. Monitoring of blood glucose concentrations and adjustments of antidiabetic drugs in patients taking niacin supplements is advisable [ 149-151 ].\n",
    "Riboflavin": "Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, is a major component of the flavoproteins flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN). These electron carriers serve as cofactors for complexes I and II in the mitochondrial ETC and are involved in fatty acid oxidation and the Krebs cycle [ 30 , 96 ].\nRiboflavin is naturally present in such foods as eggs, organ meats, lean meats, and milk. It is also present in fortified foods (e.g., grains and cereals) [ 96 ] and dietary supplements. Multivitamin/mineral supplements with riboflavin commonly provide 1.7 mg. Other supplements contain 100 to 400 mg riboflavin [ 25 ].\nMost riboflavin is absorbed in the proximal small intestine. The body absorbs little additional riboflavin from single doses beyond 27 mg and stores only small amounts of riboflavin in the liver, heart, and kidneys. Excess amounts are either not absorbed or the small amount that is absorbed is excreted in urine [ 97 ].\nThe rationale for riboflavin supplementation in patients with PMDs is to recover enzyme activity and improve complex I and II of the mitochondrial ETC [ 9 , 96 ]. Doses as high as 150 mg/day riboflavin have been studied in patients with PMDs.\nCase reports have shown benefits from riboflavin supplementation in patients with PMDs associated with complex I deficiency [ 101-103 ]. For example, 150 mg/day riboflavin for an unspecified period improved muscle strength and reduced plasma lactate and alanine concentrations in a patient with mitochondrial complex I deficiency due to acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase 9 (ACAD9) mutations [ 104 ]. In five patients with mitochondrial myopathy associated with complex I deficiency, 9 mg/day for patients younger than 12 years and 36 mg/day for older patients for 3–17 months improved muscle strength in two patients and reduced fatigue in one patient. Another patient showed improved psychomotor development and stabilization of clinical symptoms after 9 mg/day riboflavin for 25 months. Riboflavin taken at 36 mg/day for 24 months improved motor coordination, physical condition, school performance, social behavior, and/or motor abilities in one patient, but another patient experienced no benefits from the same dose [ 101 ]. In a child with mitochondrial myopathy and complex I deficiency, 20–120 mg/day riboflavin for 16 months normalized serum pyruvate and lactate concentrations and reduced muscle weakness [ 103 ]. Finally, 50 mg/day riboflavin for 3 years improved exercise tolerance and muscle tone in a patient with complex I deficiency and skeletal myopathy. Discontinuation of riboflavin for 1 month resulted in significant clinical deterioration that was reversed by resumption of supplementation [ 102 ].\nCase reports also provide some evidence supporting the benefits of riboflavin supplementation in patients with PMDs associated with complex II deficiency. In three children with this deficiency, 50–100 mg/day riboflavin for a mean 4.5 years had beneficial effects (which depended on the child), including moderate improvements in cognitive function, communicative abilities, postural control, and growth. Plasma lactate and pyruvate concentrations declined in one patient whose values were elevated at baseline [ 105 ].\nThe MMS recommends offering riboflavin supplements to patients with PMDs [ 1 ], and the standard doses are 50 to 400 mg/day [ 30 ].\nIn summary, evidence from case reports show the potentially beneficial effects of riboflavin supplementation in patients with PMDs associated with complex I and complex II deficiencies. However, further research, including RCTs and studies with larger samples, is needed to fully understand the efficacy and safety of riboflavin supplementation in these patients.\nNo adverse events were reported in children with mitochondrial complex II deficiency who received 50–100 mg/day riboflavin for 46–80 months [ 105 ]. No adverse effects from high riboflavin intakes from foods or supplements (400 mg/day for at least 3 months) have been reported, and the Food and Nutrition Board has not established a UL for riboflavin. However, the lack of reported adverse events does not necessarily mean that excessive intakes of riboflavin do not have adverse effects [ 97 , 106 ].\nFor more information on riboflavin as a dietary supplement, see the Riboflavin fact sheet from ODS.\n",
    "Thiamin": "Thiamin, also known as thiamine or vitamin B1, is naturally present in some foods, such as whole grains, meats, and fish. It is also added to some food products (i.e., breads, cereals, and infant formulas) and is available as a dietary supplement [ 107 ]. Multivitamin/mineral supplements with thiamin typically provide about 1.5 mg or more, and other supplements contain 50 to 250 mg [ 25 ]. The most common forms of thiamin in supplements are thiamin mononitrate and thiamin hydrochloride, which are stable and water soluble. Benfotiamine, a synthetic thiamin derivative used in some dietary supplements (150 to 300 mg), is not water soluble and is converted to thiamin in the body [ 25 , 108 ].\nThiamin plays an important role in energy metabolism. Thiamin pyrophosphate is the main metabolically active form of thiamin, and it serves as a cofactor for enzymes involved in glucose and amino acid metabolism. As glucose is broken down into energy, thiamin is a cofactor for the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex that converts pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A in the pyruvate decarboxylation process [ 109 ].\nThe rationale for thiamin supplementation in patients with PMDs is to improve aerobic glycolysis by enhancing pyruvate decarboxylation [ 9 ].\nOnly one small study, published in 1981, has assessed the effects of thiamin supplementation in patients with PMDs. This study found that 900 mg/day (in three divided doses) thiamin hydrochloride in three patients age 18–29 years with KSS normalized plasma lactate in two patients and pyruvate concentrations in one patient with initially abnormal levels after 5 weeks to 3 months [ 110 ]. The supplement also improved self-reported general well-being and reduced fatigue in the two patients whose plasma lactate normalized, but it had no effect in the third patient who received thiamin for 4 weeks.\nThe effects of the combination of thiamin with other dietary supplements are described in the combination therapy section.\nTo date, the evidence of efficacy of thiamin supplementation to manage PMDs comes from a single, small, open-label study. Further research, including RCTs, is needed to assess the efficacy and safety of this dietary supplement in patients with PMDs.\nIt is important to note that biotin-thiamin-responsive basal ganglia disease, an autosomal recessive disorder that results in severe neurological impairment, can mimic Leigh syndrome and responds to biotin and thiamin supplementation. Therefore, differential diagnosis is essential [ 111 ].\nThe body excretes excess amounts of thiamin in the urine [ 107 ]. Because of the lack of reports of adverse effects from high thiamin intakes (50 mg/day or more) from food or supplements, the Food and Nutrition Board has not established a UL for thiamin [ 97 ]. Thiamin supplementation does not appear to be toxic, possibly because its absorption declines rapidly with intakes greater than 5 mg. However, the lack of reported adverse events does not necessarily mean that excessive intakes of thiamin do not have adverse effects [ 97 , 112 ].\nFor more information about thiamin as a dietary supplement, see the Thiamin fact sheet from ODS.\nAlthough thiamin is not known to interact with any medications, certain medications can have an adverse effect on thiamin levels. Furosemide (Lasix) is a loop diuretic used to treat edema and hypertension by increasing urinary output. Research has linked the use of furosemide to decreases in thiamin concentrations, possibly to deficient levels, as a result of urinary thiamin loss [ 155-157 ].\n",
    "Vitamin C": "Vitamin C, also known as L-ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in some foods. The best food sources are fruits and vegetables. Vitamin C is added to some foods (including fortified breakfast cereals) and is available as a dietary supplement. Unlike most species, humans cannot synthesize vitamin C endogenously, so it is an essential dietary component [ 113 ].\nVitamin C is required for the biosynthesis of collagen, L-carnitine, and certain neurotransmitters. Vitamin C is also involved in protein metabolism [ 113 , 114 ], and it is an important physiological antioxidant [ 115 ] that can regenerate other antioxidants within the body, including alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) [ 116 ]. In addition to its function as a cofactor and antioxidant, vitamin C facilitates the intestinal absorption of nonheme iron [ 114 ].\nApproximately 70%–90% of vitamin C is absorbed at moderate intakes of 30–180 mg/day. However, at doses above 1 g/day, the absorption rate drops to less than 50%, and absorbed, unmetabolized ascorbic acid is excreted in the urine [ 116 ]. Results from pharmacokinetic studies indicate that oral doses of 1.25 g/day ascorbic acid produce mean peak plasma vitamin C concentrations of 135 micromol/L, which are about twice those produced by consuming 200–300 mg/day ascorbic acid from vitamin C-rich foods [ 117 ]. Pharmacokinetic modeling predicts that even doses as high as 3 g ascorbic acid taken every 4 hours would produce peak plasma concentrations of only 220 micromol/L [ 117 ].\nSupplements typically contain vitamin C in the form of ascorbic acid, which has equivalent bioavailability to that of naturally occurring ascorbic acid in foods, such as orange juice and broccoli [ 118 ]. Other forms of vitamin C supplements include sodium ascorbate; calcium ascorbate; other mineral ascorbates; ascorbic acid with bioflavonoids; and combination products [ 25 ].\nVitamin C has been used to treat PMDs as an antioxidant [ 9 ] and in combination with vitamin K as an electron transfer mediator to bypass complex III deficiency in the ETC [ 9 , 119 ].\nNo studies have assessed the effect of vitamin C alone in patients with PMDs. Two case reports of patients with mitochondrial myopathy associated with complex III deficiency combined vitamin C with vitamin K3 (no longer available in dietary supplements because of its hepatotoxicity) [ 119 , 120 ]. These case reports are described in the combination therapy section.\nVitamin C has low toxicity and is not believed to cause serious adverse effects at high intakes [ 114 ]. The most common adverse effects are diarrhea, nausea, abdominal cramps, and other gastrointestinal disturbances because of the osmotic effect of unabsorbed vitamin C in the gastrointestinal tract [ 114 ].\nHigh vitamin C intakes also have the potential to increase urinary oxalate and uric acid excretion, which could contribute to the formation of kidney stones, especially in individuals with renal disorders. However, studies evaluating the effects on urinary oxalate excretion of 30 mg to 10 g/day vitamin C have had conflicting results, so it is not clear whether vitamin C plays a role in kidney stone development. The best evidence that vitamin C contributes to kidney stone formation comes from patients with preexisting hyperoxaluria.\nThe ULs for vitamin C for both food and supplement intakes are 400 mg for age 1–3 years, 650 mg for age 4–8 years, 1,200 mg for age 9–13 years, 1,800 mg for age 14–18 years, and 2,000 mg for age 19 years and up [ 114 ]. Vitamin C ULs for infants have not been established. Long-term intakes of vitamin C above the UL could increase the risk of adverse health effects. However, the ULs do not apply to individuals receiving vitamin C for medical treatment, although such individuals should be under the care of a physician [ 114 ].\nFor more information on vitamin C as a dietary supplement, see the Vitamin C fact sheet from ODS.\nVitamin C in combination with other antioxidants might attenuate the increase in high-density lipoprotein levels that results from combined niacin and simvastatin (Zocor) therapy [ 152 , 153 ]. Whether this interaction occurs with other lipid-altering regimens is not known [ 149 ]. Health care providers should monitor lipid levels in individuals taking both statins and antioxidant supplements [ 149 ].\n",
    "Vitamin E": "Vitamin E is naturally present in some foods. The best sources are nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils. Vitamin E is added to other foods, including fortified breakfast cereals, and is available as a dietary supplement.\nVitamin E is the collective name for a group of fat-soluble compounds with distinctive antioxidant activities. Naturally occurring vitamin E has eight chemical forms (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherol and alpha-, beta-, gamma, and delta-tocotrienol) that have varying levels of biological activity [ 121 ]. Alpha-tocopherol is the only form known to meet human requirements. The main function of alpha-tocopherol is to act as an antioxidant that prevents the propagation of free-radical reactions and protects cell membranes from lipid peroxidation. Regeneration of vitamin E involves other reducing agents, such as vitamin C [ 114 ].\nSupplements of vitamin E typically provide only alpha-tocopherol, although mixed products containing other tocopherols and even tocotrienols are available. Alpha-tocopherol in dietary supplements and fortified foods is often esterified to prolong its shelf life while protecting its antioxidant properties. The body hydrolyzes and absorbs these esters (alpha-tocopheryl acetate and succinate) as efficiently as alpha-tocopherol [ 114 ]. Most vitamin-E–only supplements provide at least 100 IU of the nutrient [ 25 ].\nVitamin E is used to manage PMDs because of its antioxidant properties. It is often used in combination with other dietary supplements.\nNo studies have assessed the effect of vitamin E alone in patients with PMDs. The effects of the combination of vitamin E with other dietary supplements are described in the combination therapies section.\nHigh doses of alpha-tocopherol supplements can cause hemorrhages and interrupt blood coagulation in animals, and in vitro data suggest that high doses inhibit platelet aggregation. Two clinical trials have found an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke in participants taking alpha-tocopherol; one trial included Finnish male smokers who consumed 50 mg/day for an average of 6 years [ 122 ], and the other involved a large group of male physicians in the United States who consumed 400 IU every other day for 8 years [ 123 ]. Because most physicians in the latter study were also taking aspirin, this finding could indicate that vitamin E tends to cause bleeding.\nThe ULs for vitamin E are based on the potential for hemorrhagic effects. The ULs for all forms of supplemental alpha-tocopherol for children are 200 mg (300 IU) for age 1–3 years, 300 mg (450 IU) for age 4–8 years, 600 mg (900 IU) for age 9–13 years, and 800 mg (1,200 IU) for age 14–18 years. For individuals 19 years and up, the UL is 1,000 mg (1,500 IU) [ 114 ]. Vitamin E ULs for infants have not been established.\nDoses of up to 1,000 mg/day (1,500 IU/day of the natural form or 1,100 IU/day of the synthetic form) in adults appear to be safe, although the data are limited and based on small groups of people taking at least 2,000 IU for a few weeks or months. Long-term intakes above the UL increase the risk of adverse health effects [ 114 ].\nTwo meta-analyses of randomized trials have raised questions about the safety of large doses of vitamin E, including doses lower than the UL. These meta-analyses linked supplementation to small but statistically significant increases in all-cause mortality rates. One analysis found an increased risk of death at doses of 400 IU/day, although the risk began to increase at 150 IU [ 124 ]. In the other analysis of studies of antioxidant supplements for disease prevention, the highest-quality trials revealed that vitamin E, whether administered alone (10–5,000 IU/day, mean 569 IU) or in combination with up to four other antioxidants, significantly increased mortality risk [ 125 ].\nThe implications of these analyses for the potential adverse effects of high-dose vitamin E supplements are unclear [ 126-129 ]. Participants in the studies included in these analyses were typically middle-age or older and had chronic diseases or related risk factors. These participants often consumed other supplements in addition to vitamin E. Some of the studies analyzed took place in developing countries in which nutritional deficiencies are common. A review of the subset of studies in which vitamin E supplements were given to healthy individuals for the primary prevention of chronic disease found no convincing evidence that the supplements increased mortality rates [ 130 ].\nHowever, results from the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial show that vitamin E supplements (400 IU/day) might harm adult men in the general population by increasing their risk of prostate cancer [ 131 ]. Follow-up studies are assessing whether the cancer risk is associated with baseline blood levels of vitamin E and selenium before supplementation as well as whether changes in one or more genes might increase a man’s risk of developing prostate cancer while taking vitamin E.\nFor more information on vitamin E as a dietary supplement, see the Vitamin E fact sheet from ODS.\nVitamin E can inhibit platelet aggregation and antagonize vitamin K–dependent clotting factors. As a result, taking large doses with anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, such as warfarin (Coumadin), can increase the risk of bleeding, especially in conjunction with low vitamin K intakes. The amounts of supplemental vitamin E needed to produce clinically significant effects are unknown but probably exceed 400 IU/day [ 149 ].\nSome people take vitamin E supplements with other antioxidants, such as vitamin C, selenium, and beta-carotene. This collection of antioxidant ingredients can blunt the rise in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, especially levels of HDL2, the most cardioprotective HDL component, among people treated with a combination of simvastatin (Zocor) and niacin [ 152 , 153 ].\n",
    "Vitamin K": "Vitamin K, the generic name for a family of compounds with a common chemical structure of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in some foods [ 132 ]. These compounds include phylloquinone (vitamin K1), present primarily in green leafy vegetables, that is the main dietary form of vitamin K [ 21 ]. The compounds also include a series of menaquinones (MK-4 through MK-13, known as vitamin K2) that are predominantly of bacterial origin and are present in modest amounts in various animal-based and fermented foods [ 132 , 133 ]. Several forms of vitamin K are used in dietary supplements, including vitamin K1 as phylloquinone or phytonadione (a synthetic form of vitamin K1) and vitamin K2 as MK-4 or MK-7 [ 25 ]. Few data are available on the bioavailability of the various forms of vitamin K supplements. One study found that both phytonadione and MK-7 supplements are well absorbed, but MK-7 has a longer half-life [ 134 ]. Vitamin K3, also known as menadione, is hepatotoxic and is no longer used in dietary supplements [ 20 , 21 ].\nVitamin K is present in most multivitamin/mineral supplements, typically in low amounts. It is also available in dietary supplements containing only vitamin K or vitamin K combined with a few other nutrients, frequently calcium, magnesium, and/or vitamin D. These supplements tend to have a wider range of vitamin K doses than multivitamin/mineral supplements [ 25 ].\nVitamin K functions as a coenzyme for vitamin K-dependent carboxylase, an enzyme required for the synthesis of proteins involved in hemostasis (blood clotting) and bone metabolism, and other diverse physiological functions [ 21 ]. Vitamin K3 was used in combination with vitamin C as electron transfer mediators to bypass complex III deficiency in the ETC in patients with PMDs [ 9 , 119 ]. Case reports and studies using vitamin K3 are summarized in this fact sheet because of the value of reviewing the available data on the efficacy of this combination of nutrients. Vitamin K1 has also been used to manage PMDs [ 135 ].\nNo studies have assessed the efficacy of vitamin K supplementation alone in patients with PMDs. In two patients with mitochondrial myopathy associated with complex III deficiency, vitamin K3 in combination with vitamin C was used [ 110-112 ]. These reports and a trial of vitamin K1 in combination with carnitine, CoQ 10 , vitamin B complex, and vitamin C are described in the combination therapies section.\nVitamin K has low potential for toxicity. The Food and Nutrition Board has not established ULs for this nutrient, as no adverse effects have been reported [ 21 ].\nVitamin K3 (menadione) was shown to damage hepatic cells in laboratory studies conducted during the 1980s and 1990s, so it is no longer used in dietary supplements or fortified foods [ 20 , 21 ].\nFor more information on vitamin K as a dietary supplement, see the Vitamin K fact sheet from ODS.\nVitamin K can have a serious and potentially dangerous interaction with anticoagulants. These drugs antagonize the activity of vitamin K, leading to the depletion of vitamin K- dependent clotting factors. People taking warfarin and similar anticoagulants need to maintain a consistent intake of vitamin K from food and supplements because sudden changes in vitamin K intakes can increase or decrease the anticoagulant effect [ 154 ].\n",
    "Combination Therapies": "Combinations of vitamins and other compounds are often used to manage PMDs, even though little evidence supports their safety and efficacy in this setting. A survey on clinical practices for the management of mitochondrial diseases showed that 14 of 32 physicians begin the use of vitamins as combinations rather than one at a time [ 19 ]. According to respondents, 69% of physicians recommend unique combinations, 13% use carnitine and CoQ 10 , and 9% use a combination of creatine, CoQ 10 , and B-complex vitamins [ 19 ].\nOnly a few published studies and case reports, described below by combination name in alphabetical order, have addressed the effects of specific combinations. Except for case reports, whose findings need to be replicated in RCTs, these studies have found few if any effects of combination supplements in patients with PMDs.\n",
    "Alpha lipoic acid, Coenzyme Q10, and creatine": "A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study examined the effects of 120 mg CoQ 10 , 3 g creatine, and 300 mg ALA or placebo twice daily for 2 months, with a 5-week washout period, in 18 patients with MELAS, CPEO, KSS, LHON, MNGIE, or other mitochondrial diseases [ 28 ]. The outcome measures included biochemical analyses, strength measures, and pulmonary function. The results showed significant reductions in resting plasma lactate and oxidative stress levels but no effects on pulmonary function (force vital capacity and force expiratory volume) or strength measures (handgrip strength, ankle dorsiflexion fatigue, and knee extension). Patients with MELAS showed the greatest improvement with this supplement combination. The study did not report on safety or adverse events.\n",
    "Carnitine and riboflavin": "A case report found that a combination of 2 g/day L-carnitine and 9 mg/day riboflavin for 7 months improved clinical symptoms and normalized complex I activity in a 6-year-old with myopathy (associated with complex I deficiency) and a pure motor neuropathy [ 136 ]. After supplementation, the patient was able to run with mild foot drop and to ride a bike. Hand strength was almost normal, but tendon reflexes could not be elicited. Eighteen months after discharge, the patient had only a slight weakness in the peroneal muscles, and tendon reflexes were normal. The study did not report on safety or adverse events.\n",
    "Carnitine, Coenzyme Q10, vitamin C, vitamin K1, and vitamin B complex (biotin, cyanocobalamin, folic acid, niacin, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, riboflavin, and thiamin)": "An open-label trial evaluated the effects of a 12-month supplementation regimen that combined 5 mg/kg/day CoQ 10 ; 500 mg/day carnitine; 1,000 mg/day vitamin C; 0.4 mg/kg/day vitamin K1; and a vitamin B complex containing 25 mg/day riboflavin, 25 mg/day thiamin, 25 mg/day niacin, 25 mg/day pyridoxine, 25 mg/day pantothenic acid, 25 mcg/day biotin, 25 µg/day cyanocobalamin, and 1 mg/day folic acid in 12 patients with LHON, CPEO, MELAS, NARP, or cytochrome c oxidase deficiency [ 135 ]. Although one patient each with LHON, CPEO, and MELAS reported increased energy levels and improved exercise tolerance, the other nine patients, including some with the same conditions, showed no clinical improvement. Furthermore, one patient with CPEO reported worsening of symptoms. No side effects from the therapy were reported.\n",
    "Carnitine, Coenzyme Q10, vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin K3, and riboflavin": "A 1998 open-label study evaluated a combination of 100–200 mg/kg/day carnitine, 50–100 mg/kg/day vitamin E, 80–300 mg/kg/day CoQ 10 as ubiquinone, 50–100 mg/day riboflavin, 80–160 mg/day vitamin K3, and 2 g/day vitamin C for 18 months. The study included 13 pediatric patients with CPEO and ptosis; CPEO with encephalopathy and epilepsy; KSS; or a variety of clinical symptoms, including epilepsy, ataxia, muscle weakness, ptosis, hypotonia, spasticity, neuropathy, and myopathy [ 137 ]. Outcomes of therapy differed, and the best responses (e.g., reductions in motor symptoms) were in patients with milder clinical forms of these diseases. The study did not report on safety or adverse events. Vitamin K3 is hepatotoxic and is no longer used in dietary supplements [ 20 , 21 ].\n",
    "Coenzyme Q10, vitamin C, vitamin E, and vitamin K3": "A 1995 open-label study evaluated the effects of a combination therapy in 16 patients with mitochondrial myopathy, KSS, MELAS, or MERRF [ 138 ]. The therapy consisted of 30–120 mg/day CoQ 10 , 20–60 mg/day vitamin K3, 2 g/day vitamin C, 400 IU/day vitamin E as alpha-tocopherol, and 2–16 mg every other day of methylprednisolone (to increase muscle strength and decrease serum lactate). No conclusions can be made about the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy based on the study design, data, and reporting of results. Duration of therapy and follow-up time after the therapy ended are not clear. In addition, the reported data are insufficient to evaluate the supplementation’s effects on clinical outcomes. Moreover, some patients died during the study, but the authors did not explain whether these deaths could have been related to the use or discontinuation of the therapy. The study did not report on safety or adverse events. Vitamin K3 is hepatotoxic and is no longer used in dietary supplements [ 20 , 21 ].\n",
    "Coenzyme Q10, vitamin C, vitamin K3, niacin, riboflavin, and thiamin": "A 1993 open-label trial evaluated the effects of a combination of 300 mg/day CoQ 10 ; 60 mg/day vitamin K3; 2 g/day vitamin C; and a supplement containing 25 mg riboflavin, 100 mg thiamin, 200 mg niacin, and 500 mg vitamin C during two or more 2-month treatment periods in 16 patients with KSS, MERRF, myopathy, or both myopathy and demyelinating neuropathy [ 139 ]. The results showed no significant differences in serum lactate levels or urinary lactate-to-creatine ratios after treatment. Similarly, no significant differences were observed in measures of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism or clinical symptoms. Adverse events included temporary thrombocytopenia and diarrhea in some of the patients. Vitamin K3 is hepatotoxic and is no longer used in dietary supplements [ 20 , 21 ].\n",
    "Folinic acid and riboflavin": "In a case report, adding 1.2 mg/kg folinic acid and 0.5–1 mg/kg riboflavin to a folate-free dietary regimen improved neurological symptoms in a patient with mitochondrial complex I deficiency and CSF 5-MTHF deficiency [ 140 ]. A combination of 2 mg/kg/day CoQ 10 , 10 mg/kg vitamin C, and 25 IU/kg vitamin E reduced seizure frequency but had no effect on clinical symptoms. Adding folinic acid and riboflavin to this combination controlled seizures after 1 year and reduced muscle hypotonia (poor muscle tone) and ataxia after 4 years but had no effect on cognitive impairment or lower limb pyramidal deficits. The patient also showed marked recovery from demyelination of the brainstem, thalamus, basal ganglia, and white matter. The study did not report on safety or adverse events.\n",
    "Vitamin C and vitamin K3": "In two case reports published in 1984 and 1995, vitamin K3 was combined with vitamin C in patients with PMDs associated with complex III deficiency.\nIn the first case report, supplementation with 40 mg/day vitamin K3 and 4 g/day vitamin C in a patient with complex III deficiency improved exercise tolerance and such activities as walking and climbing stairs and decreased fatigue within 2 days of starting supplementation; however, blood lactate levels did not decrease [ 120 ]. Phosphorus 31 nuclear magnetic resonance was used to measure the bioenergetic capacity of skeletal muscle. Doubling the dose of vitamin K3 to 80 mg/day did not result in further improvement; however, withdrawal of supplementation resulted in deterioration of clinical symptoms, and this deterioration disappeared in less than 24 hours after vitamin K3 supplementation was resumed. No toxicity was reported with the higher dose of vitamin K3 [ 141 ]. In the second report of a patient with complex III deficiency, 40 mg/day vitamin K3 and 4 g/day vitamin C for 9 months improved mitochondrial function in the brain and produced a minor but not significant improvement in skeletal muscle [ 119 ]. The supplementation had no effect on lactate levels, but it did mildly reduce ataxia after 3 months. This study did not report on safety or adverse events. Vitamin K3 is hepatotoxic and is no longer used in dietary supplements [ 20 , 21 ].\n",
    "Folinic acid": "Folinic acid is used in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) to enhance 5-FU’s effects, but it might also enhance 5-FU’s toxicity [ 95 , 146 ]. High-doses of folinic acid might reduce the antiepileptic effects of phenytoin, phenobarbital, and primidone, potentially increasing the number of seizures in pediatric patients [ 95 ].\n",
    "Weighing the Evidence for Using Dietary Supplements to Manage PMDs": "When the scientific literature is assessed for evidence of dietary supplements' effectiveness in supporting patients with PMDs, several general research and clinical challenges emerge.\nTranslating research results into clinical care decisions, even when higher levels of evidence for causality from RCTs on a particular dietary supplement for PMDs are available, is problematic because of the large variability in study designs and outcome measures used.\nIn some cases, clinical studies investigate a dietary supplement intervention in multiple PMD conditions and report outcomes without differentiating the level of response between specific PMDs, which may mask indications of effectiveness for only a specific condition. Conversely, indications of effectiveness in a specific PMD do not necessarily support use of the same intervention in a different condition.\nA general lack of consistency in the outcome measures used in studies, which include biochemical, physical, and neurological measures, limits the ability to assess the reproducibility of the research results and identify trends in efficacy. For this reason, mitochondrial specialists participated in a project sponsored by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke to identify common data elements for PMDs to assist with future clinical trial designs [ 162 ].\nPatients' baseline status with respect to specific nutrients and cofactors is not always determined before supplementation begins, making unclear whether the intervention corrected an underlying deficiency. Furthermore, without rigorously validated biomarkers for specific health outcomes, it is difficult to know how reported alterations in biochemical measures, such as blood lactate concentration or PCr/Pi ratio, might or might not translate into a clinically relevant improvement in a patient’s health and function [ 163 ].\nChallenges also abound in relation to the extent to which dietary supplement products used in PMD clinical research are characterized. Dietary supplements are complex products, and their formulations can dramatically affect the bioavailability and bioactivity of their ingredients. The compositions of products manufactured by pharmaceutical companies and biomedical research supply companies might only minimally resemble those of products available to patients and consumers in the marketplace. The studies reviewed in this document of all of these types of interventions offer limited details on the similarities between the products used in the studies and those available commercially. In addition, different supplement products labeled with the same ingredient can be formulated with different isomers, oxidation states, or stabilizing agents. Unfortunately, reporting on these important characteristics in materials and methods sections of research studies is often inadequate for the reader to confidently determine the exact nature of the intervention. In some cases, study reports provide only the common name of the experimental intervention (e.g., simply CoQ 10 ), which makes it nearly impossible to rigorously reproduce or follow up on the results in future studies.\nThese research design and intervention characterization issues, combined with the wide range of intervention doses and durations reported for certain ingredients (and the general lack of dose-response investigations), make comparison across studies challenging. These weaknesses also create a significant barrier to making definitive conclusions about dietary supplement effectiveness for managing PMDs.\n",
    "Regulation and Quality of Dietary Supplements": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations for dietary supplements are different from those for prescription or over-the-counter drugs. Unlike drugs, which must be approved by FDA before they can be marketed, dietary supplements do not require premarket approval by FDA. The supplement company is responsible for having evidence that their products are safe and the label claims are truthful and not misleading. However, if a dietary supplement contains a new ingredient , manufacturers must notify FDA about that ingredient prior to marketing. The notification will be reviewed by FDA, but only for safety, not effectiveness.\nFDA has issued Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) for dietary supplements, a set of requirements and expectations by which dietary supplements must be manufactured, prepared, and stored to ensure quality. In addition, several nongovernmental organizations conduct product testing and GMP auditing programs. Dietary supplement products that display the seals from these independent certification programs give consumers more assurance that the product contains the ingredients and amounts listed on the label and that it does not contain harmful contaminants or adulterants. Importantly, the GMPs for dietary supplements and the certification programs do not guarantee that a product is safe or effective.\nFor more information on dietary supplements, see the ODS health information page.\n",

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet .\n",
    "Introduction": "Riboflavin (also known as vitamin B2) is one of the B vitamins, which are all water soluble. Riboflavin is naturally present in some foods, added to some food products, and available as a dietary supplement. This vitamin is an essential component of two major coenzymes, flavin mononucleotide (FMN; also known as riboflavin-5'-phosphate) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). These coenzymes play major roles in energy production; cellular function, growth, and development; and metabolism of fats, drugs, and steroids [ 1-3 ]. The conversion of the amino acid tryptophan to niacin (sometimes referred to as vitamin B3) requires FAD [ 3 ]. Similarly, the conversion of vitamin B6 to the coenzyme pyridoxal 5'-phosphate needs FMN. In addition, riboflavin helps maintain normal levels of homocysteine, an amino acid in the blood [ 1 ].\nMore than 90% of dietary riboflavin is in the form of FAD or FMN; the remaining 10% is comprised of the free form and glycosides or esters [ 2 , 3 ]. Most riboflavin is absorbed in the proximal small intestine [ 4 ]. The body absorbs little riboflavin from single doses beyond 27 mg and stores only small amounts of riboflavin in the liver, heart, and kidneys. When excess amounts are consumed, they are either not absorbed or the small amount that is absorbed is excreted in urine [ 3 ].\nBacteria in the large intestine produce free riboflavin that can be absorbed by the large intestine in amounts that depend on the diet. More riboflavin is produced after ingestion of vegetable-based than meat-based foods [ 2 ].\nRiboflavin is yellow and naturally fluorescent when exposed to ultraviolet light [ 1 ]. Moreover, ultraviolet and visible light can rapidly inactivate riboflavin and its derivatives. Because of this sensitivity, lengthy light therapy to treat jaundice in newborns or skin disorders can lead to riboflavin deficiency. The risk of riboflavin loss from exposure to light is the reason why milk is not typically stored in glass containers [ 3 , 5 ].\nRiboflavin status is not routinely measured in healthy people. A stable and sensitive measure of riboflavin deficiency is the erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity coefficient (EGRAC), which is based on the ratio between this enzyme's in vitro activity in the presence of FAD to that without added FAD [ 1 , 6 , 7 ]. The most appropriate EGRAC thresholds for indicating normal or abnormal riboflavin status are uncertain [ 6 ]. An EGRAC of 1.2 or less is usually used to indicate adequate riboflavin status, 1.2–1.4 to indicate marginal deficiency, and greater than 1.4 to indicate riboflavin deficiency [ 1 , 6 ]. However, a higher EGRAC does not necessarily correlate with the degree of riboflavin deficiency. Furthermore, the EGRAC cannot be used in people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, which is present in about 10% of African Americans [ 8 ].\nAnother widely used measure of riboflavin status is fluorometric measurement of urinary excretion over 24 hours (expressed as total amount of riboflavin excreted or in relation to the amount of creatinine excreted) [ 2 ]. Because the body can store only small amounts of riboflavin, urinary excretion reflects dietary intake until tissues are saturated [ 6 ]. Total riboflavin excretion in healthy, riboflavin-replete adults is at least 120 mcg/day; a rate of less than 40 mcg/day indicates deficiency [ 1 , 6 ]. This technique is less accurate for reflecting long-term riboflavin status than EGRAC [ 1 , 6 ]. Also, urinary excretion levels can decrease with age and increase with exposure to stress and certain drugs, and the amount excreted strongly reflects recent intake [ 1 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for riboflavin and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies [ 3 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nTable 1 lists the current RDAs for riboflavin [ 3 ]. For infants from birth to 12 months, the FNB established an AI for riboflavin that is equivalent to the mean intake of riboflavin in healthy, breastfed infants.\n* AI\n",
    "Food": "Foods that are particularly rich in riboflavin include eggs, organ meats (kidneys and liver), lean meats, and milk [ 2 , 4 ]. Some vegetables also contain riboflavin. Grains and cereals are fortified with riboflavin in the United States and many other countries [ 4 ]. The largest dietary contributors of total riboflavin intake in U.S. men and women are milk and milk drinks, bread and bread products, mixed foods whose main ingredient is meat, ready-to-eat cereals, and mixed foods whose main ingredient is grain [ 3 ]. The riboflavin in most foods is in the form of FAD, although the main form in eggs and milk is free riboflavin [ 9 ].\nAbout 95% of riboflavin in the form of FAD or FMN from food is bioavailable up to a maximum of about 27 mg of riboflavin per meal or dose [ 3 ].The bioavailability of free riboflavin is similar to that of FAD and FMN [ 9 , 10 ]. Because riboflavin is soluble in water, about twice as much riboflavin content is lost in cooking water when foods are boiled as when they are prepared in other ways, such as by steaming or microwaving [ 11 ].\nSeveral food sources of riboflavin are listed in Table 2.\n*DV = Daily Value. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for riboflavin is 1.3 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 13 ]. FDA does not require food labels to list riboflavin content unless riboflavin has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) FoodData Central [ 12 ] lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing riboflavin arranged by nutrient content and food name .\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "Riboflavin is available in many dietary supplements. Multivitamin/mineral supplements with riboflavin commonly provide 1.3 mg riboflavin (100% of the DV) [ 14 ]. Supplements containing riboflavin only or B-complex vitamins (that include riboflavin) are also available. In most supplements, riboflavin is in the free form, but some supplements have riboflavin 5'-phosphate.\n",

    "Cancer prevention": "Experts have theorized that riboflavin might help prevent the DNA damage caused by many carcinogens by acting as a coenzyme with several different cytochrome P450 enzymes [ 1 ]. However, data on the relationship between riboflavin and cancer prevention or treatment are limited and study findings are mixed.\nA few large observational studies have produced conflicting results on the relationship between riboflavin intakes and lung cancer risk. A prospective study followed 41,514 current, former, and never smokers in the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study for 15 years, on average [ 47 ]. The average riboflavin intake among all participants was 2.5 mg/day. The results showed a significant inverse association between dietary riboflavin intake and lung cancer risk in current smokers (fifth versus first quintile) but not former or never smokers. However, another cohort study in 385,747 current, former, and never smokers who were followed for up to 12 years in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition found no association between riboflavin intakes and colorectal cancer risk in any of the three groups [ 48 ]. Moreover, the prospective Canadian National Breast Screening Study showed no association between dietary intakes or serum levels of riboflavin and lung cancer risk in 89,835 women age 40–59 from the general population over 16.3 years, on average [ 49 ].\nObservational studies on the relationship between riboflavin intakes and colorectal cancer risk have not yielded conclusive results either. An analysis of data on 88,045 postmenopausal women in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study showed that total intakes of riboflavin from both foods and supplements were associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer [ 50 ]. A study that followed 2,349 individuals with cancer and 4,168 individuals without cancer participating in the Netherlands Cohort Study on Diet and Cancer for 13 years found no significant association between riboflavin and proximal colon cancer risk among women [ 51 ].\nFuture studies, including clinical trials, are needed to clarify the relationship between riboflavin intakes and various types of cancer and determine whether riboflavin supplements might reduce cancer risk.\n",

    "Migraine headaches": "Migraine headaches typically produce intense pulsing or throbbing pain in one area of the head [ 38 ]. These headaches are sometimes preceded or accompanied by aura (transient focal neurological symptoms before or during the headaches). Mitochondrial dysfunction is thought to play a causal role in some types of migraine [ 39 ]. Because riboflavin is required for mitochondrial function, researchers are studying the potential use of riboflavin to prevent or treat migraine headaches [ 40 ].\nSome, but not all, of the few small studies conducted to date have found evidence of a beneficial effect of riboflavin supplements on migraine headaches in adults and children. In a randomized trial in 55 adults with migraine, 400 mg/day riboflavin reduced the frequency of migraine attacks by two per month compared to placebo [ 41 ]. In a retrospective study in 41 children (mean age 13 years) in Italy, 200 or 400 mg/day riboflavin for 3 to 6 months significantly reduced the frequency (from 21.7 ± 13.7 to 13.2 ± 11.8 migraine attacks over a 3-month period) and intensity of migraine headaches during treatment [ 42 ]. The beneficial effects lasted throughout the 1.5-year follow-up period after treatment ended. However, two small randomized studies in children found that 50 to 200 mg/day riboflavin did not reduce the number of migraine headaches or headache severity compared to placebo [ 43 , 44 ].\nThe Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society concluded that riboflavin is probably effective for preventing migraine headaches and recommended offering it for this purpose [ 45 ]. The Canadian Headache Society recommends 400 mg/day riboflavin for migraine headache prevention, noting that although the evidence supporting this recommendation is of low quality, there is some evidence for benefit and side effects (such as discolored urine) are minimal [ 46 ].\n",

    "Riboflavin Intakes and Status": "Most people in the United States consume the recommended amounts of riboflavin. An analysis of data from the 2003–2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) showed that less than 6% of the U.S. population has an intake of riboflavin from foods and supplements below the EAR [ 15 ]. An analysis of self-reported data from the 1999–2004 NHANES found that intakes of riboflavin were higher in lacto-ovo vegetarians (2.3 mg/day) than nonvegetarians (2.1 mg/day) [ 16 ].\nAmong children and teens, the average daily riboflavin intake from foods is 1.8 mg for age 2–5 years, 1.9 mg for age 6–11, and 2.1 mg for age 12–19 [ 17 ]. In adults, the average daily riboflavin intake from foods is 2.5 mg in men and 1.8 mg in women. The average daily riboflavin intake from foods and supplements in children and teens is 2.1 mg for age 2–5 years, 2.2 mg for age 6–11, and 2.3 mg for age 12–19. In adults age 20 and older, the average daily riboflavin intake from foods and supplements is 4.5 mg in men and 4.7 mg in women.\n",
    "Riboflavin Deficiency": "Riboflavin deficiency is extremely rare in the United States. In addition to inadequate intake, causes of riboflavin deficiency can include endocrine abnormalities (such as thyroid hormone insufficiency) and some diseases [ 1 ]. The signs and symptoms of riboflavin deficiency (also known as ariboflavinosis) include skin disorders, hyperemia (excess blood) and edema of the mouth and throat, angular stomatitis (lesions at the corners of the mouth), cheilosis (swollen, cracked lips), hair loss, reproductive problems, sore throat, itchy and red eyes, and degeneration of the liver and nervous system [ 1-3 , 8 ]. People with riboflavin deficiency typically have deficiencies of other nutrients, so some of these signs and symptoms might reflect these other deficiencies. Severe riboflavin deficiency can impair the metabolism of other nutrients, especially other B vitamins, through diminished levels of flavin coenzymes [ 3 ]. Anemia and cataracts can develop if riboflavin deficiency is severe and prolonged [ 1 ].\nThe earlier changes associated with riboflavin deficiency are easily reversed. However, riboflavin supplements rarely reverse later anatomical changes (such as formation of cataracts) [ 1 ].\n",
    "Groups at Risk of Riboflavin Inadequacy": "The following groups are among those most likely to have inadequate riboflavin status.\n",
    "Vegetarian athletes": "Exercise produces stress in the metabolic pathways that use riboflavin [ 18 ]. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Dietitians of Canada, and the American College of Sports Medicine state that vegetarian athletes are at risk of riboflavin deficiency because of their increased need for this nutrient and because some vegetarians exclude all animal products (including milk, yogurt, cheese, and eggs), which tend to be good sources of riboflavin, from their diets [ 19 ]. These associations recommend that vegetarian athletes consult a sports dietitian to avoid this potential problem.\n",
    "Pregnant and lactating women and their infants": "Pregnant or lactating women who rarely consume meats or dairy products (such as those living in developing countries and some vegetarians in the United States) are at risk of riboflavin deficiency, which can have adverse effects on the health of both mothers and their infants [ 2 ]. Riboflavin deficiency during pregnancy, for example, can increase the risk of preeclampsia [ 20 ]. The limited evidence on the benefits of riboflavin supplements during pregnancy in both developed and developing countries is mixed [ 21-23 ].\nRiboflavin intakes during pregnancy have a positive association with infant birth weight and length [ 24 ]. Infants of mothers with riboflavin deficiency or low dietary intakes (less than 1.2 mg/day) during pregnancy have a higher risk of deficiency and of certain birth defects (such as outflow tract defects of the heart) [ 22 , 25 ]. However, maternal riboflavin intake has no association with the risk of orofacial clefts in infants [ 26 ].\nIn well-nourished women, riboflavin concentrations in breast milk range from 180 to 800 mcg/L and concentrations of riboflavin in breast milk increase over time [ 27 , 28 ]. In developing countries, in contrast, riboflavin levels in breast milk range from 160 to 220 mcg/L [ 27 ].\n",
    "People who are vegan and/or consume little milk": "In people who eat meat and dairy products, these foods contribute a substantial proportion of riboflavin in the diet. For this reason, people who live in developing countries and have limited intakes of meat and dairy products have an increased risk of riboflavin deficiency [ 29 , 30 ]. Vegans and those who consume little milk in developed countries are also at risk of riboflavin inadequacy [ 31-35 ].\n",
    "People with riboflavin transporter deficiency": "Riboflavin transporter deficiency (formerly known as Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere or Fazio-Londe syndrome) is a rare neurological disorder. It can begin between infancy and young adulthood and is associated with hearing loss, bulbar palsy (a motor-neuron disease), respiratory difficulties, and other symptoms [ 36 , 37 ]. The disease is caused by mutations in the SLC52A3 or SLC52A2 genes, which encode riboflavin transporters. As a result, these patients cannot properly absorb and transport riboflavin, so they develop riboflavin deficiency. Although no cure exists for riboflavin transporter deficiency, high-dose riboflavin supplementation can be a life-saving treatment in this population, especially when it is initiated soon after symptom onset.\n",
    "Riboflavin and Health": "This section focuses on two conditions in which riboflavin might play a role: migraine headaches and cancer.\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Riboflavin": "Intakes of riboflavin from food that are many times the RDA have no observable toxicity, possibly because riboflavin's solubility and capacity to be absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract are limited [ 1 , 3 ]. Because adverse effects from high riboflavin intakes from foods or supplements (400 mg/day for at least 3 months) have not been reported, the FNB did not establish ULs for riboflavin [ 3 ]. The limited data available on riboflavin's adverse effects do not mean, however, that high intakes have no adverse effects, and the FNB urges people to be cautious about consuming excessive amounts of riboflavin [ 3 ].\n",
    "Riboflavin and Healthful Diets": "The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) MyPlate.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Milk and yogurt are high in riboflavin. Enriched grains are good sources of riboflavin. Quinoa and some fruits and vegetables contain riboflavin. Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. Beef is rich in riboflavin. Chicken, fish, nuts, and eggs are good sources of riboflavin. Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Limits alcoholic beverages.

    "Introduction": "Selenium is an essential mineral that is naturally present in many foods and added to others. It is also available as a dietary supplement. Selenium is a constituent of 25 selenoproteins, including thioredoxin reductases, glutathione peroxidases, and selenoprotein P [ 1 ]. Selenoproteins play critical roles in thyroid hormone metabolism, DNA synthesis, reproduction, and protection from oxidative damage and infection [ 2-4 ].\nSoil and ground water contain inorganic forms of selenium (e.g., selenites and selenates) that plants accumulate and convert to organic forms, mostly selenomethionine and selenocysteine and their methylated derivatives. In foods, selenium is present primarily as selenomethionine along with selenocysteine. Dietary selenium is readily absorbed by the body and absorption is largely not affected by selenium status [ 4-6 ].\nAbsorbed selenomethionine and inorganic selenium is rapidly metabolized to a common intermediate that is used for synthesizing selenocysteine, the form of selenium found in the 25 human selenoproteins. Approximately 28% to 46% of the total body’s selenium content is found in skeletal muscle [ 7 ]. Selenium homeostasis is maintained primarily by urinary excretion and, in cases of higher selenium intake, through the lungs and feces [ 3 , 4 , 6 ].\nThe most commonly used measures of selenium status are plasma and serum selenium concentrations [ 2 , 4 ]. Plasma or serum selenium concentrations of 8 micrograms (mcg)/dL or higher in healthy people are considered sufficient for selenoprotein synthesis [ 8 ]. Concentrations in plasma, serum, and urine reflect recent selenium intake whereas selenium concentrations in whole blood (including erythrocytes) indicate long term status. Analyses of hair and nail selenium content are also used to monitor long term intakes, over months or years [ 3 , 4 ].\nThe two predominant selenoproteins in plasma are glutathione peroxidase 3 and selenoprotein P, and both can be used as functional biomarkers of selenium status [ 1 , 3 , 9 ]. However, some experts question the reliability of these two biomarkers to indicate selenium deficiency because plasma selenoprotein concentrations can be affected by inflammation and oxidative stress [ 4 , 10 ]. In addition, research suggests that selenium supplementation does not increase selenoprotein P concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity unless individuals are selenium deficient [ 3 , 4 , 6 , 9 , 11 , 12 ]. Urinary methylated selenometabolites are not reliable selenium status biomarkers because many people lack the methylation enzymes due to genetic polymorphisms [ 4 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for selenium and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [ 13 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nTable 1 lists the current RDAs for selenium in mcg. For infants from birth to 12 months, the FNB established an AI for selenium that is equivalent to the mean intake of selenium in healthy, breastfed infants.\n*Adequate Intake (AI)\n",

    "Cancer": "Because of its effects on DNA repair, apoptosis, and the endocrine and immune systems as well as other mechanisms, including its antioxidant properties, selenium has been hypothesized to play a role in the prevention of cancer [ 15 , 55-57 ]. Results from animal studies also suggest that selenium may have chemopreventive properties [ 3 , 6 ]. Researchers have examined the effects of selenium primarily for prostate, breast, lung, and colorectal cancers, with prostate cancer being the most extensively studied.\nEpidemiological studies have suggested an inverse association between selenium status and the risk of colorectal, prostate, lung, bladder, skin, esophageal, and gastric cancers. In addition, a few early clinical trials found that selenium supplements reduced the risk of some forms of cancer, but more recent trials have not supported these findings [ 58 , 59 ].\nThe Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial, which began recruitment in 1983, was a randomized controlled trial that investigated 200 mcg/day selenium as selenium yeast or placebo for a mean of 4.5 years in 1,312 men and women in the United States with histories of nonmelanoma skin cancer [ 60 , 61 ]. Although selenium supplementation did not reduce the recurrence of nonmelanoma skin cancer, a secondary analysis of the trial found that men who took selenium had a 49% lower risk of prostate cancer than those who took placebo over a mean follow-up of about 7.5 years. The effect was strongest among men with the lowest baseline plasma selenium concentrations (below 10.6 mcg/dL), with no effect among men with plasma selenium concentrations greater than 12.3 mcg/dL.\nThe subsequent Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT), however, did not find that selenium supplementation reduced the risk of prostate cancer. This randomized, controlled trial in 35,533 men age 50 years or older from the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico was discontinued after 5.5 years when analyses showed no association between prostate cancer risk and supplementation with 200 mcg/day selenium as selenomethionine with or without 400 international units (IU)/day vitamin E [ 62 ]. An additional 1.5 years of follow-up data on participants after they stopped taking the study supplements confirmed the lack of a significant association between selenium supplementation and prostate cancer risk [ 63 ]. Further investigation in a case-cohort of 1,739 men diagnosed with prostate cancer and 3,117 matched controls from the SELECT trial found that selenium supplementation did not affect prostate cancer risk in men with low baseline selenium status (based on toenail selenium levels) [ 64 ]. However, the researchers did find an increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer in men with higher baseline selenium status (≥ 60 th percentile of toenail selenium) and recommended that men over age 55 avoid selenium supplementation at doses that exceed recommended dietary intakes.\nA 2018 Cochrane Review on selenium for the prevention of cancer included 83 studies (including the studies described above) [ 59 ]. Among the 70 observational cohort studies reviewed, participants with the highest baseline selenium status had a 28% lower cancer risk and a 24% lower cancer mortality than those with the lowest status. In addition, these participants had a 33% lower risk of bladder cancer; an 18% lower risk of lung cancer; an 18% lower risk of colorectal cancer; and, in men, a 16% lower risk of prostate cancer. The authors found no association between selenium status in women and risk of breast cancer. However, due to major weaknesses in study design, confounders, and limitations in the assessment of selenium exposure, the certainty of evidence for these findings was very low. In addition, no evidence of a dose-response relationship between selenium status and cancer risk was observed.\nThe 10 randomized, placebo-controlled trials examined in the 2018 Cochrane Review included a total of 27,232 participants, 94% of which were men [ 59 ]. Results from these studies showed that supplementing with 200 to 500 mcg/day selenium, primarily as selenomethionine, for 2 to 10.3 years had little to no effect on cancer incidence or mortality. The certainty of evidence was high for prostate, colorectal, lung, and bladder cancers and moderate for breast and nonmelanoma skin cancers. Because most of the studies used 200 mcg/day selenium, the authors concluded that 200 mcg/day selenium does not reduce the overall risk of cancer or the risk of individual cancer types. They also concluded that more research is needed to determine if selenium supplementation might modify cancer risk in individuals with specific genetic backgrounds or nutritional status or if different forms of selenium have different effects [ 10 , 59 ].\nStarting in 2003, FDA allowed two qualified health claims that some scientific evidence suggests consumption of selenium “may reduce the risk of certain forms of cancer” and “may produce anticarcinogenic effects.” However, FDA determined that this evidence is limited and not conclusive [ 65 ]. In 2009, FDA evaluated additional qualified health claims for selenium and denied claims for many forms of cancer but allowed qualified health claims for three forms of cancer, noting that FDA concludes it is “highly uncertain” that selenium supplements reduce the risk of bladder cancer in women or the risk of thyroid cancer, and “highly unlikely” that selenium supplements reduce the risk of prostate cancer [ 66 ].\nMore research is needed to fully understand the relationship between selenium status and cancer risk and to determine whether selenium supplements can help prevent any form of cancer.\n\n",

    "Cardiovascular disease": "Selenoproteins help reduce inflammation and prevent lipid oxidation and platelet aggregation [ 67 , 68 ]. For these reasons, experts have hypothesized that selenium supplements could reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease or deaths associated with cardiovascular disease.\nResults from early observational studies suggested that low selenium status might increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. A 2006 meta-analysis of 25 observational studies primarily in men over age 40 reported an inverse association between selenium concentrations and risk of coronary heart disease [ 69 ]. Mean serum selenium concentrations ranged from 5.18 to 13.07 mcg/dL; men with the highest selenium concentrations had a 15% lower risk of coronary heart disease than those with the lowest.\nSince then, epidemiological studies on the role of selenium in cardiovascular disease have yielded conflicting findings. A study in 1,042 middle-age White men and women (mean age 40.8 years) reported that higher plasma selenium concentrations (mean 12.4 mcg/dL) were associated with higher total and non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels [ 70 ]. On the other hand, a study in 13,887 adults in the United States showed no association between baseline serum selenium concentrations (mean 12.56 mcg/dL) and cardiovascular mortality over 12 years of follow-up [ 71 ]. Similarly, an 18-year prospective study in 3,112 young adult men and women (age 20–32 years at baseline) reported no association between baseline toenail selenium levels and changes in carotid intima-media thickness or coronary artery calcium score at the end of the study [ 72 ].\nSeveral clinical trials have examined whether selenium supplementation alone or as part of a multivitamin/mineral supplement reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. In one trial, 474 healthy adults age 60 to 74 years with a mean baseline plasma selenium concentration of 9.12 mcg/dL took 100, 200, or 300 mcg/day selenium as selenium yeast or placebo for 6 months [ 73 ]. Selenium supplements providing 100 and 200 mcg/day lowered total plasma cholesterol an average of 8.5 and 9.7 mg/dL and non-HDL cholesterol by 7.7 and 10.4 mg/dL, respectively, while 300 mcg/day selenium increased HDL levels by 2.3 mg/dL. However, the study authors noted that the clinical significance of these findings is unclear. Other trials have found that supplementation with selenium alone (100, 200, or 300 mcg/day) or supplementation with a multivitamin/mineral product containing selenium (100 mcg/day) does not reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease or cardiac death [ 67 , 74-76 ].\nThe SELECT trial (detailed in the Cancer section, above) assessed cardiovascular risk as a secondary outcome in 17,488 well-nourished men and found no effect of 200 mcg/day selenium on risk of cardiovascular events over 7 to12 years, compared with placebo [ 63 ]. A Cochrane Review of SELECT and 11 other smaller randomized trials providing 100 to 800 mcg/day selenium supplementation for 2 weeks to 12 years in a total of 19,715 predominantly male adults also found that selenium supplements did not reduce the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events [ 68 ]. All studies were assessed as having a low risk of bias.\nAlthough studies suggest that supplementing with selenium does not reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, including selenium in antioxidant mixtures may reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality. A meta-analysis and systematic review included 43 randomized trials in adults who took either selenium supplements alone or as part of antioxidant formulas for at least 24 weeks (antioxidant formulas were defined by the researchers as containing two or more of the following: selenium, retinol, beta-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, or copper) [ 77 ]. Selenium alone, providing 100 to 400 mcg/day, or antioxidant formulas with or without 50 to 200 mcg selenium were not associated with cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular mortality, compared with placebo. However, when the antioxidant formula trials were separated into selenium-containing or not, cardiovascular mortality was reduced by 23% in participants taking the antioxidant formulas containing selenium, compared with those who took antioxidant formulas that did not contain selenium.\nOverall, clinical trial evidence does not support the use of selenium supplementation for reducing the risk of heart disease, particularly in healthy people who obtain sufficient selenium from food. Additional clinical trials are needed to better understand any contributions of selenium from food and dietary supplements to cardiovascular health.\n\n",

    "Sources of Selenium": "Because selenium in foods is protein bound, foods that are high in protein tend to be the best sources of selenium. Brazil nuts, seafood, meat, poultry, and organ meats are the richest food sources of selenium. Other sources include cereals and other grains, and dairy products [ 6 ]. The amount of selenium in drinking water is not nutritionally significant in most geographic regions [ 3 , 13 ]. The major food sources of selenium in the diets of people in the United States are breads, grains, meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs [ 14 ].\nThe amount of selenium in a given type of plant-based food depends on the amount and form of selenium in the soil and several other factors, such as soil pH and amount of organic matter in the soil [ 3 , 13 , 15 ]. As a result, selenium concentrations in plant-based foods vary widely by geographic location [ 2 , 15 ]. For example, according to FoodData Central from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Brazil nuts have an average of 544 mcg selenium/ounce, but values from other analyses vary widely [ 16-18 ].\nThe selenium content of soil affects the amount of selenium in the plants that animals eat. However, this does not substantially affect the amount of selenium in animal products because animals maintain predictable tissue concentrations of selenium through homeostatic mechanisms [ 3 , 6 ]. Furthermore, formulated livestock feeds generally contain selenium at consistent levels [ 19 ].\nSeveral food sources of selenium are listed in Table 2.\n*DV = Daily Value. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for selenium is 55 mcg for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 20 ]. FDA does not require food labels to list selenium content unless selenium has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. USDA’s FoodData Central [ 18 ] lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing selenium arranged by nutrient content and by food name .\n",
    "Dietary Supplements": "Selenium is available in multivitamin/mineral supplements, in supplements containing vitamin E and other ingredients, and as stand-alone supplements. Common forms include selenomethionine, selenium-enriched yeast (grown in a high-selenium medium, predominantly as selenomethionine), sodium selenite, and sodium selenate [ 21-23 ]. Doses of selenium in multivitamin/mineral supplements vary, but many contain 55 mcg. The amount of selenium is often higher in supplements with fewer ingredients. For example, supplements that combine selenium with vitamin E or other ingredients generally contain 50 to 200 mcg of selenium. Selenium-only supplements typically contain 100 to 400 mcg [ 21 ].\nThe human body absorbs up to about 90% of selenium from selenomethionine, selenium-enriched yeast, selenite, and selenate [ 4-6 , 9 , 12 , 24 ].\n",
    "Selenium Intakes and Status": "Most people in the United States consume adequate amounts of selenium. In addition,17% to 19% of adults use a dietary supplement containing selenium [ 25 ].\nAccording to an analysis of data from the 2017–March 2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the average daily selenium intake in people age 2 years and older from foods and beverages is 108 mcg and from foods, beverages, and supplements is 116 mcg [ 25 ]. Adult men have higher daily intakes (132 mcg from foods and beverages and 145 mcg from foods, beverages, and supplements) than adult women (94 mcg from foods and beverages and 102 mcg from foods, beverages, and supplements).\nDietary selenium intakes are similar among people who are Black and those who are White. People who follow a vegetarian or vegan dietary pattern may have lower selenium intakes than others [ 26-28 ].\nAccording to an analysis of NHANES data from 2011 to 2016, the mean serum selenium concentration in males and females age 8 to 80 years is 12.7 mcg/dL [ 29 ]. Research indicates that men have slightly higher serum selenium concentrations than women, and people who are White have higher concentrations than those who are Black [ 30-33 ]. Selenium status is lower in people who smoke, possibly because smoking increases oxidative stress [ 34 ].\nSelenium intakes and serum concentrations in the United States and Canada vary somewhat by region because of differences in the amounts of selenium in soil and in local foods consumed [ 3 , 13 ]. For example, residents of the Midwestern and Western United States have higher concentrations than those living in the South and Northeast [ 32 , 35 ]. However, the extensive transport of food in the United States typically allows people living in low-selenium areas to obtain sufficient amounts of selenium [ 13 ].\n",
    "Selenium Deficiency": "Selenium deficiency alone rarely causes overt illness, but it produces biochemical changes that might predispose people who experience additional stresses to develop certain illnesses [ 13 , 36 ]. For example, Keshan disease is an endemic cardiomyopathy that was first identified in 1935 in parts of China where the soil is low in selenium. Adults in these areas had average selenium intakes of no more than 10 mcg/day whereas intakes of at least 20 mcg/day protect adults from the disease [ 3 , 13 ]. Keshan disease mainly affects women of childbearing age and preschool children. Although prevalence is low today, the disease still exists [ 3 , 36 , 37 ]. The etiology of Keshan disease remains unknown, but disease incidence dramatically reduced following several large intervention trials in the 1970s to 1990s that provided selenium selenite supplements. A 2018 systematic review and meta-analysis of 41 studies found that selenium supplements (doses not indicated) reduce the risk of Keshan Disease by 86% [ 38 ].\nSelenium deficiency is also associated with Kashin-Beck disease, a type of osteoarthritis that commonly presents in childhood and puberty and occurs in certain low-selenium and low-iodine areas of China, Tibet, Siberia, and North Korea [ 3 , 13 , 39 , 40 ].\nSelenium deficiency could exacerbate iodine deficiency, potentially increasing the risk of congenital hypothyroidism in infants [ 3 , 8 ]. Endemic myxedematous hypothyroidism is a disease that occurs in regions with very low selenium levels, such as Central Africa, and is thought to develop during gestation or early childhood. Individuals with this condition produce insufficient thyroid hormone and present with very low plasma triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) levels and extremely high thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels [ 3 ].\n",
    "Groups at Risk of Selenium Inadequacy": "Selenium deficiency is very rare in the United States and Canada [ 13 ]. However, some people, including those living in certain other countries, may obtain insufficient amounts of selenium. The following groups are among those most likely to have inadequate intakes of selenium.\n",
    "People living in selenium-deficient regions": "Selenium intakes in North America, even in low-selenium regions, are well above the RDA [ 41 ], likely because most people consume foods originating from a wide geographic area. However, people in some countries whose diet consists primarily of vegetables grown in low-selenium areas are at risk of deficiency [ 13 ]. The lowest selenium intakes in the world are in certain parts of China, where large proportions of the population have a primarily vegetarian diet and soil selenium levels are very low [ 3 ]. Average selenium intakes are also low in some European countries, especially among populations consuming vegan diets [ 4 , 42 ]. Although intakes in New Zealand were low in the past, they rose after the country increased its importation of high-selenium wheat [ 15 ].\n",
    "People undergoing kidney dialysis": "Selenium concentrations are often significantly lower in patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis than in healthy individuals partly because hemodialysis removes some selenium from the blood [ 43-46 ]. In addition, hemodialysis patients are at risk of low dietary selenium intakes due to anorexia resulting from uremia and dietary restrictions [ 44 , 46 , 47 ]. However, whether selenium concentrations are sufficient in hemodialysis patients also depends on individual selenium status. For example, median selenium concentrations were above the 95th percentile of normal (normal reference: median 9.2 mcg/dL) at baseline and remained elevated in a 2-year prospective cohort study of 198 hemodialysis patients in Western Canada [ 47 ]. Although selenium supplementation increases blood concentrations in hemodialysis patients, more evidence is needed to determine whether supplements have beneficial clinical effects in these individuals.\n",
    "People living with HIV": "People living with HIV often have low selenium concentrations, possibly due to malabsorption or inadequate selenium intakes [ 48 ]. The prevalence of selenium deficiency in people living with HIV varies by country, reflecting variable selenium content of the soil [ 49 ]. Observational studies have found an association between lower selenium concentrations in people with HIV and an increased risk of cardiomyopathy; worsening of disease progression; death; and, in pregnant women, HIV transmission to offspring and early death of offspring [ 50-54 ]. However, randomized trials suggest selenium supplementation has little effect on HIV disease progression or treatment.\n",
    "Selenium and Health": "This section focuses on six diseases and conditions in which selenium might play a role: cancer , cardiovascular disease , cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease , HIV infection , male fertility , and thyroid disease .\n\n",
    "Cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease": "Selenoproteins have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, and serum selenium concentrations decline with age [ 78 , 79 ]. In addition, chronic selenium deficiencies are correlated with cognitive decline [ 80 , 81 ]. For these reasons, researchers have hypothesized that higher selenium intakes might reduce the risk of cognitive decline.\nAn analysis of 2011–2014 NHANES data showed that higher whole blood selenium concentrations and higher selenium intakes were associated with higher cognitive scores in older adults [ 33 , 82 ]. However, results from other observational studies have been mixed [ 83-86 ]. A study in 1,012 men and women in Italy (mean age 75 years) reported that lower plasma selenium concentrations were associated with subtle neurological impairments [ 79 ]. Participants in the lowest quartile of plasma selenium (less than 6.67 mcg/dL) had worse neuro-motor performance than those in the highest quartile (more than 8.23 mcg/dL). In contrast, a study in 154 healthy people in Australia (96% women, average age 71 years), 85% of whom had replete selenium concentrations (average plasma selenium 16.9 mcg/dL), found no association between plasma selenium concentrations and cognitive outcomes [ 81 ].\nResearchers have evaluated whether taking an antioxidant supplement containing selenium reduces the risk of cognitive impairment in older adults. A post hoc analysis of the Supplémentation en Vitamines et Minéraux Antioxydants (SU.VI.MAX) study in 4,447 participants age 45 to 60 years in France found that, compared with placebo, people who took a daily supplement containing 100 mcg selenium with 120 mg ascorbic acid, 30 mg vitamin E, 6 mg beta-carotene, and 20 mg zinc for 8 years had higher episodic memory and semantic fluency test scores 6 years after supplementation ended [ 87 ]. However, selenium’s independent contribution to the observed effects in this study cannot be determined.\nObservational studies have found that individuals with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have lower blood selenium concentrations compared with cognitively healthy older adults [ 88 , 89 ]. The Prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease with Vitamin E and Selenium (PREADVISE) trial was the first large-scale primary prevention trial to study the effects of selenium (200 mcg/day as selenomethionine) and vitamin E (400 IU/day) in 7,540 cognitively healthy men age 60 years and older [ 90 ]. However, during the 5.4 years of supplement use, the trial found no difference in the incidence of new AD or dementia among participants taking selenium only, vitamin E only, or selenium plus vitamin E, compared with placebo.\nA 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 clinical trials evaluated the effects of supplements containing selenium only or selenium plus other nutrients in adults age 69 to 89 years with mild cognitive impairment or AD [ 91 ]. Supplements containing both organic and inorganic forms of selenium were used. Results from these studies showed that selenium-only supplements at various doses and selenium plus other nutrient supplements for 12 to 24 weeks did not improve cognitive test scores.\nSelenium may play a role in maintaining healthy brain function, but clinical evidence does not support the use of selenium supplementation in replete individuals for reducing the risk of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults.\n\n",
    "HIV infection": "In children and adults with HIV, selenium deficiency is associated with a higher risk of morbidity and mortality [ 54 ]. However, studies examining whether micronutrient supplementation, including selenium, affects risk of HIV transmission or disease outcomes in children and adults have had mixed results. An observational study in Thailand did not identify associations between selenium status in children with HIV and treatment outcomes [ 92 ]. This study included 141 boys and girls with HIV (median age 7.3 years), 97 of whom started antiretroviral therapy (ART) over a period of 48 weeks. Baseline selenium concentrations (all of which were adequate) showed no associations with ART treatment outcomes.\nClinical trials have found limited benefits of selenium supplementation on immune function in people with HIV. A clinical trial in Rwanda examined the effects of selenium supplementation on CD4+ T-cell counts in 300 men and women age 21 years and older with HIV [ 93 ]. Participants had CD4+ T-cell counts between 400 and 650 cells/mcL, so they were not yet eligible for ART and they took 200 mcg/day selenium or placebo for 24 months. During the trial, average CD4+ T-cell counts declined in both the treatment and placebo groups, but the rate of depletion was 43.8% lower in those who took selenium. However, selenium supplementation had no effect on the composite endpoint of a CD4+ count less than 350 cells/mcL or initiation of ART.\nSelenium supplementation provided no benefits in a randomized controlled trial in Iran in which 146 men and women receiving ART for HIV (mean age 38.6 years) took 50 mg/day zinc, 200 mcg/day selenium, or placebo for 6 months. The investigators then followed participants for another 3 months but found that selenium supplementation did not raise CD4+ T-cell counts [ 94 ].\nTwo Cochrane Reviews also concluded that selenium supplements offer little, if any, benefit for people with HIV. The first review examined whether micronutrient supplementation reduces the burden of HIV infection in children [ 95 ]. It included 3 clinical trials that administered 30 or 60 mcg/day selenium as part of a multiple-micronutrient formulation in children with HIV who were living in South Africa or Uganda. The authors found that evidence was insufficient to determine whether supplementation with selenium alone is beneficial. Similarly, the authors of a second Cochrane Review of 4 clinical trials in a total of 1,187 adults with HIV concluded that 200 mcg/day selenium for 9 to 24 months may have little to no effect on CD4+ T-cell count and viral load [ 96 ]. They also concluded the evidence was insufficient to determine whether selenium supplementation affects the risk of hospital admission in adults with HIV.\nResearchers have also examined whether blood selenium concentration or selenium supplementation affects pregnancy outcomes in women with HIV. These studies have found associations between low blood selenium concentrations and higher risk of preterm birth, and they suggest that selenium supplementation might reduce the risk of preterm birth. For example, a cross-sectional study in Nigeria of 113 pregnant adolescents and women age 15 to 49 years with HIV found that those with a selenium deficiency (defined as blood selenium less than 7 mcg/dL) at 14 to 26 weeks of gestation were almost eight times as likely to have a preterm birth as those with normal selenium concentrations [ 97 ]. Individuals with a low CD4+ T-cell count also had an eight-fold higher risk of preterm birth. In a clinical trial in Nigeria, researchers examined whether selenium supplementation affected pregnancy outcomes and disease progression in 90 pregnant women with HIV (mean age 29.7 years) at 14 to 27 weeks of gestation [ 98 ]. In this trial, participants took 200 mcg/day selenium or placebo between enrollment and delivery. Those who took selenium had a 68% lower risk of preterm birth than those who took placebo, but the risk of low birthweight did not differ between the two groups. In addition, selenium supplementation did not affect the levels of HIV infection markers (CD4+ T-cell counts and viral load).\nOverall, clinical evidence on whether selenium supplementation affects risk of HIV transmission or disease outcomes is inconclusive, although limited evidence suggests that it might reduce the risk of preterm birth in women with HIV. More research is needed to determine whether selenium supplementation benefits children and adults with HIV.\n\n",
    "Male fertility": "Infertility is considered a global public health issue, affecting about 15% of the world’s population. Observational studies suggest that consuming a healthy diet may improve sperm quality [ 99 ]. Certain nutrients, such as selenium, may also play a role, possibly because they reduce oxidative stress that has been linked to male infertility. In addition, the selenoprotein phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase is a major constituent and structural component of mature sperm [ 100 ]. A 5-year prospective study in idiopathic infertile men found that both low and high selenium semen concentrations were associated with male infertility and reproductive failures [ 101 , 102 ].\nClinical trials evaluating selenium supplementation on sperm quality have had conflicting findings. A trial in 54 healthy men (nonsmokers) age 18 to 45 years administered 300 mcg/day selenium (as selenium yeast) or placebo for 48 weeks [ 103 ]. No differences in sperm concentration or motility were found between groups, and semen volume declined in both groups.\nIn contrast, a 3-month trial in Scotland in 69 men (mean age 33 years) with reduced sperm motility and low selenium plasma concentrations (mean 8.1 mcg/dL) found that 100 mcg/day selenium as selenomethionine improved plasma selenium concentrations, sperm motility, and chance of conception compared with placebo. No additional benefits were found when vitamins A, C, and E were included with the selenium supplement [ 102 ]. Another 3-month trial that provided 200 mcg/day selenium as selenium yeast or 200 mg/day coenzyme Q10 to 70 men (average age 25 years) with idiopathic infertility reported increases in total and progressive sperm motility in those taking selenium [ 104 ]. However, this trial did not have a placebo group or measure baseline selenium status.\nMore research is needed to determine whether selenium supplements affect male fertility.\n\n",
    "Thyroid disease": "Selenium concentration is higher in the thyroid gland than in any other organ in the body and, like iodine, selenium has important functions in thyroid hormone synthesis and metabolism [ 105 ]. For example, selenoproteins play critical roles in the conversion of the prohormone T4 to the active T3. In addition, the selenoproteins glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase help protect the thyroid gland from the hydrogen peroxide produced during thyroid hormone synthesis [ 15 , 105 ].\nEpidemiological studies have found associations between low selenium status and increased risk of thyroid disease. However, this effect has been observed only in women [ 23 , 106 , 107 ]. For example, data from 1,900 middle-age men and women with mean serum selenium concentrations of 12.4 mcg/dL showed an inverse association between serum selenium concentrations and thyroid volume and a protective effect of selenium against risk of goiter in the women participants, but not the men [ 108 ]. A cross-sectional study in 805 women age 18 to 65 and men age 60 to 65 years in Denmark with mean serum selenium concentrations of 9.7 mcg/dL and mild iodine deficiency also found an inverse association between serum selenium concentration and thyroid volume in the women only [ 107 ].\nA randomized trial administered 100, 200, or 300 mcg/day selenium as selenium yeast for 6 months in 368 healthy men and women age 60 to 74 years with mean baseline plasma selenium concentrations of 9.13 mcg/dL. It reported no effect on thyroid function, even though plasma selenium concentrations increased in all three groups [ 109 ].\nChronic autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT), also called Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, affects 1 to 2 percent of the population, particularly middle-age females [ 110 ]. Several clinical trials have investigated the effect of selenium supplementation on thyroid antibodies in people with AIT. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 16 trials assessed the effects of selenium supplementation on serum thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) and thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) levels in those with AIT who were treated with levothyroxine compared with those newly diagnosed and not treated with levothyroxine [ 111 ]. The trials included a total 1,494 adults (mainly women) who were administered 80 to 200 mcg/day selenium (as selenomethionine or sodium selenite) for 3 to 12 months and all but two trials were placebo controlled. Five trials reported baseline serum selenium concentrations ranging from 3.7 to 8.5 mcg/dL, indicating deficient to marginal selenium status in many participants; the other trials did not report baseline selenium status. In the levothyroxine-treated groups, selenium supplementation lowered TPOAb levels. In addition, selenomethionine was more effective than sodium selenite at lowering TPOAb, possibly because of higher absorption. In the levothyroxine-untreated groups of newly diagnosed participants, selenium supplementation lowered TPOAb and TgAb levels in the 3-month studies but not in the 6- or 12-month studies.\nOther trials have evaluated the effects of selenium supplementation on thyroid function and quality of life in adults with AIT. A systematic review included 9 controlled trials (all of which were included in the 16-study review described above) in 679 predominantly female participants (mean age approximately 39–48 years) [ 110 ]. Some of the trials also administered levothyroxine, but analyses were limited to trials using selenium alone. Results showed that selenium supplementation ranging from 80 to 200 mcg/day as selenomethionine or sodium selenite for 3 to 12 months did not affect TSH levels, thyroid echogenicity (ultrasound, a measure of hypothyroidism), or health-related quality of life. As in the above-mentioned review, participants had deficient to marginal selenium status in seven of the nine trials that reported on status. The authors concluded that the evidence does not support the use of selenium supplementation for AIT.\nUp to 50% of pregnant women who are TPOAb or TgAb positive in the first trimester will develop postpartum thyroiditis, and 20% to 40% of these women will develop permanent primary hypothyroidism [ 23 ]. However, results have been mixed from clinical trials examining the effects of selenium supplementation in this population. In one trial, 151 pregnant White women age 18 to 36 years who were TPOAb positive with normal thyroid function and marginal selenium status (mean 8.09 mcg/dL) took 200 mcg/day selenium as selenomethionine or placebo from 12.5 weeks of gestation through 12 months postpartum [ 112 ]. Of the participants in the selenium group, 28.6% developed postpartum thyroid disorders compared with 48.6% of those in the placebo group. In addition, 11.7% of participants in the selenium group developed permanent hypothyroidism compared with 20.3% in the placebo group. Another trial provided 83 mcg/day selenium as selenomethionine to 45 pregnant women who were TPOAb and/or TgAb positive. It also reported reductions in these antibodies at 6 months postpartum compared with placebo [ 113 ]. However, a trial that provided 60 mcg/day selenium as selenium yeast to TPOAb positive pregnant women who were mild to moderately iodine deficient showed no reduction in TPOAb levels at delivery [ 114 ].\nIn 2017, the American Thyroid Association issued a weak recommendation against the use of selenium supplementation for pregnant women who are TPOAb positive based on moderate quality evidence [ 115 ].\nAlthough selenium is involved with normal thyroid function, more research is needed to understand the role of selenium supplements in thyroid disease, particularly by gender and selenium status.\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Selenium": "Chronically high intakes of the organic and inorganic forms of selenium have similar effects [ 13 ]. Early indicators of excess intake are a garlic odor in the breath and a metallic taste in the mouth. The most common clinical signs of chronically high selenium intakes, or selenosis, are hair loss and nail brittleness or loss. Other signs and symptoms include skin rash, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, irritability, and nervous system abnormalities [ 3 , 13 , 62 ].\nAs discussed earlier, Brazil nuts contain very high amounts of selenium (68–91 mcg per nut) and could cause selenium toxicity if consumed regularly. Acute selenium toxicity has resulted from the ingestion of misformulated over-the-counter products containing very large amounts of selenium [ 8 , 55 ]. In 2008, for example, 201 people experienced severe adverse reactions from taking a liquid dietary supplement containing 200 times the labeled amount of selenium [ 116 ]. Acute selenium toxicity can cause severe gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms; acute respiratory distress syndrome; myocardial infarction; hair loss; muscle tenderness; tremors; lightheadedness; facial flushing; kidney failure; cardiac failure; and, in rare cases, death [ 13 , 55 ].\nThe FNB has established ULs for selenium from food and supplements based on the amounts of selenium that are associated with hair and nail brittleness and loss (see Table 3) [ 13 ]. These ULs, however, do not apply to people taking selenium under the care of a physician.\nIn 2023, the Panel on Nutrition, Novel Foods and Food Allergens of the European Food Safety Authority released a scientific opinion on the ULs for selenium [ 117 ]. Based on systematic reviews that examined associations between excess selenium intake and clinical effects, specifically alopecia, the panel set an upper limit for selenium of 255 mcg/day for all adults, including women who are pregnant or lactating, with lower amounts ranging from 70 to 230 mcg/day for children and teens, depending on age.\n",
    "Cisplatin": "Cisplatin, an inorganic platinum chemotherapy agent, is used to treat ovarian, bladder, lung, and other cancers. Cisplatin can reduce selenium levels in hair and serum but whether these reductions have a clinically significant impact is not known [ 118 , 119 ]. Some small studies have shown that selenium supplementation can reduce cisplatin’s toxicity [ 120 ], but the authors of a Cochrane Review concluded that the evidence that selenium supplementation alleviates the side effects of chemotherapy is insufficient [ 121 ].\n",
    "Selenium and Healthful Diets": "The federal government’s 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that “Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. … In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).” [ 122 ]\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA’s MyPlate .\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Many whole grains and dairy products, including milk and yogurt, are good sources of selenium. Some ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are fortified with selenium, and some fruits and vegetables contain selenium. Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. Pork, beef, turkey, chicken, fish, shellfish, and eggs contain high amounts of selenium. Brazil nuts contain particularly high levels of selenium. Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Limits alcoholic beverages. Stays within your daily calorie needs.\nMany whole grains and dairy products, including milk and yogurt, are good sources of selenium.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet .\n",
    "Introduction": "Thiamin (or thiamine) is one of the water-soluble B vitamins. It is also known as vitamin B1. Thiamin is naturally present in some foods, added to some food products, and available as a dietary supplement. This vitamin plays a critical role in energy metabolism and, therefore, in the growth, development, and function of cells [ 1 ].\nIngested thiamin from food and dietary supplements is absorbed by the small intestine through active transport at nutritional doses and by passive diffusion at pharmacologic doses [ 1 ]. Most dietary thiamin is in phosphorylated forms, and intestinal phosphatases hydrolyze them to free thiamin before the vitamin is absorbed [ 1 ]. The remaining dietary thiamin is in free (absorbable) form [ 1 , 2 ]. Humans store thiamin primarily in the liver but in very small amounts [ 3 ]. The vitamin has a short half-life, so people require a continuous supply of it from the diet.\nAbout 80% of the approximately 25–30 mg of thiamin in the adult human body is in the form of thiamin diphosphate (TDP; also known as thiamin pyrophosphate), the main metabolically active form of thiamin. Bacteria in the large intestine also synthesize free thiamin and TDP, but their contribution, if any, to thiamin nutrition is currently unknown [ 4 ]. TDP serves as an essential cofactor for five enzymes involved in glucose, amino acid, and lipid metabolism [ 1 , 3 ].\nLevels of thiamin in the blood are not reliable indicators of thiamin status. Thiamin status is often measured indirectly by assaying the activity of the transketolase enzyme, which depends on TDP, in erythrocyte hemolysates in the presence and absence of added TDP [ 3 ]. The result, known as the TDP effect, reflects the extent of unsaturation of transketolase with TDP. The result is typically 0%–15% in healthy people, 15%–25% in those with marginal deficiency, and higher than 25% in people with deficiency. Another commonly used measure of thiamin status is urinary thiamin excretion, which provides data on dietary intakes but not tissue stores [ 5 ]. For adults, excretion of less than 100 mcg/day thiamin in urine suggests insufficient thiamin intake, and less than 40 mcg/day indicates an extremely low intake [ 6 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for thiamin and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies (formerly National Academy of Sciences) [ 7 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nTable 1 lists the current RDAs for thiamin [ 7 ]. For infants from birth to 12 months, the FNB established an AI for thiamin that is equivalent to the mean intake of thiamin in healthy, breastfed infants.\n*AI\n",
    "Food": "Food sources of thiamin include whole grains, meat, and fish [ 2 ]. Breads, cereals, and infant formulas in the United States and many other countries are fortified with thiamin [ 2 ].The most common sources of thiamin in the U.S. diet are cereals and bread [ 8 ]. Pork is another major source of the vitamin. Dairy products and most fruits contain little thiamin [ 3 ]. About half of the thiamin in the U.S. diet comes from foods that naturally contain thiamin; the remainder comes from foods to which thiamin has been added [ 9 ].\nHeating foods containing thiamin can reduce their thiamin content. For example, bread has 20%–30% less thiamin than its raw ingredients, and pasteurization reduces thiamin content (which is very small to begin with) in milk by up to 20% [ 3 ]. Because thiamin dissolves in water, a significant amount of the vitamin is lost when cooking water is thrown out [ 3 ]. Processing also alters thiamin levels in foods; for example, unless white rice is enriched with thiamin, it has one-tenth the amount of thiamin in unenriched brown rice [ 10 ].\nData on the bioavailability of thiamin from food are very limited [ 7 ]. Some studies do show, however, that thiamin absorption increases when intakes are low [ 1 ].\nSeveral food sources of thiamin are listed in Table 2.\n*DV = Daily Value. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for thiamin is 1.2 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 11 ]. FDA does not require food labels to list thiamin content unless thiamin has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) FoodData Central website [ 10 ] lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing thiamin arranged by nutrient content and by food name .\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "Thiamin is available in many dietary supplements. Multivitamin/mineral supplements with thiamin typically provide about 1.5 mg thiamin and sometimes more [ 12 ]. Supplements containing B-complex vitamins (including thiamin) or thiamin only are also available. The most commonly used forms of thiamin in supplements are thiamin mononitrate and thiamin hydrochloride, which are stable and water soluble [ 1 , 12 ].\nBenfotiamine is a synthetic thiamin derivative that is used in some dietary supplements. Benfotiamine is not water soluble and is converted to thiamin in the body [ 13 ].\n",

    "Alzheimer’s disease": "According to animal model studies, thiamin deficiency might play a role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease [ 51 ]. For example, thiamin deficiency produces oxidative stress in neurons, death of neurons, loss of memory, plaque formation, and changes in glucose metabolism—all markers of Alzheimer’s disease. Autopsy studies have shown that transketolase and other thiamin-dependent enzymes have decreased activity in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease [ 52 , 53 ].\nFew studies have assessed the prevalence of thiamin deficiency in people with Alzheimer’s disease. One of these studies found that 13% of 150 patients with cognitive impairment and acute-onset behavioral disturbances were considered thiamin deficient based on plasma levels [ 26 ].\nThe authors of a 2001 Cochrane Review assessed three double-blind, randomized trials (including two crossover trials) that compared the effects of 3 g/day oral thiamin to placebo on cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer’s type dementia [ 54 ]. The three studies randomly assigned fewer than 20 patients each, and the two crossover studies did not include a washout period [ 55-57 ]. The review authors stated that it was not possible to draw any conclusions from these three studies because they were small and the publications describing them did not provide enough detail to combine these data in a meta-analysis.\nLarger, well-designed studies are needed to determine whether thiamin supplements are beneficial for Alzheimer’s disease.\n",

In a study of 76 consecutive patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, for example, 8% had mild thiamin deficiency and 32% had moderate deficiency based on assays of the transketolase enzyme [ 33 ].\nSome small studies have shown that oral supplementation with 150–300 mg/day thiamin can decrease glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance [ 41 , 42 ]. However, the authors of these studies did not assess the potential clinical significance of these findings.\nA few small randomized studies have assessed the effects of benfotiamine supplements on diabetic neuropathy. Three studies found that, compared to placebo, 120–900 mg/day benfotiamine with or without other B-vitamins decreased the severity of neuropathy symptoms and lowered urinary albumin excretion (a marker of early-stage diabetic nephropathy) [ 43-45 ]. However, another study found no effect of 900 mg/day benfotiamine on urinary excretion of albumin or kidney injury molecule-1, a marker of kidney injury [ 46 ].\nWell-designed studies with larger sample sizes and longer durations are required to determine whether thiamin supplements can reduce glucose levels in patients with diabetes or decrease diabetic compications.\n",

    "Thiamin Intakes and Status": "Most people in the United States consume the recommended amounts of thiamin. An analysis of data from the 2003–2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey showed that only 6% of the U.S. population has a usual intake below the EAR [ 9 ].\nAmong children and teens, the average daily thiamin intake from foods is 1.27 mg for ages 2–5 years, 1.54 mg for ages 6–11 years, and 1.68 mg for ages 12–19 years [ 14 ]. In adults age 20 and older, the average daily thiamin intake from foods is 1.95 mg in men and 1.39 mg in women. The average daily thiamin intake from foods and supplements in children and teens is 1.51 mg for ages 2–5 years, 1.76 mg for ages 6–11 years, and 1.95 mg for ages 12–19 years. In adults age 20 and older, the average daily thiamin intake from foods and supplements is 4.89 mg in men and 4.90 mg in women.\nNo current data on rates of thiamin deficiency in the U.S. population are available.\n",
    "Thiamin Deficiency": "In addition to insufficient intakes of thiamin from the diet, the causes of thiamin deficiency include lower absorption or higher excretion rates than normal due, for example, to certain conditions (such as alcohol dependence or HIV/AIDS) or use of some medications [ 3 ].\nIn its early stage, thiamin deficiency can cause weight loss and anorexia, confusion, short-term memory loss, and other mental signs and symptoms; muscle weakness; and cardiovascular symptoms (such as an enlarged heart) [ 7 ].\nThe most common effect of thiamin deficiency is beriberi, which is characterized mainly by peripheral neuropathy and wasting [ 1-3 ]. People with this condition have impaired sensory, motor, and reflex functions. In rare cases, beriberi causes congestive heart failure that leads to edema in the lower limbs and, occasionally, death [ 1 , 3 ]. Although beriberi is rare in the United States and other developed countries, people in these countries do occasionally develop the condition [ 15-18 ]. Administration of supplemental thiamin, often parenterally, quickly cures beriberi [ 2 , 3 ].\nA more common manifestation of thiamin deficiency in the United States is Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome [ 2 ]. This disorder is about 8–10 times more common in people with chronic alcoholism than in the general population, but it can also develop in patients who have severe gastrointestinal disorders, rapidly progressing hematologic malignancies, drug use disorders, or AIDS [ 2 ]. In many patients, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome has two phases. The first, acute, and life-threatening stage, Wernicke’s encephalopathy, is usually characterized by peripheral neuropathy [ 3 , 19 ]. Without treatment, up to 20% of people with Wernicke’s encephalopathy die; those who survive develop Korsakoff’s psychosis, although some people with Korsakoff’s psychosis have not previously had Wernicke’s encephalopathy [ 20 , 21 ]. Korsakoff’s psychosis, an effect of chronic thiamin deficiency, is associated with severe short-term memory loss, disorientation, and confabulation (confusion between real and imagined memories) [ 1-3 ]. At this chronic state of the disorder, parenteral thiamin treatment does not lead to recovery in about one-quarter of patients [ 22 ].\nThe World Health Organization recommends daily oral doses of 10 mg thiamin for a week, followed by 3–5 mg/daily for at least 6 weeks, to treat mild thiamin deficiency [ 23 ]. The recommended treatment for severe deficiency consists of 25–30 mg intravenously in infants and 50–100 mg in adults, then 10 mg daily administered intramuscularly for approximately 1 week, followed by 3–5 mg/day oral thiamin for at least 6 weeks.\n",
    "Groups at Risk of Thiamin Inadequacy": "The following groups are among those most likely to have inadequate thiamin status.\n",
    "People with HIV/AIDS": "People with HIV infection have an increased risk of thiamin deficiency and its sequelae, including beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome [ 1 , 28 ]. Autopsies of 380 people with AIDS found that almost 10% had Wernicke’s encephalopathy [ 29 ], and some experts believe that thiamin deficiency is underdiagnosed in this population [ 30 ]. The association between thiamin deficiency and HIV/AIDS is probably due to malnutrition as a result of the catabolic state associated with AIDS.\n",
    "People with diabetes": "Some small studies have found that thiamin levels in plasma are up to 76% lower in people with type 1 diabetes than in healthy volunteers and 50%–75% lower in people with type 2 diabetes [ 31 , 32 ]. Other studies have shown a higher risk of thiamin deficiency in people with type 1 and/or type 2 diabetes based on tests of erythrocyte transketolase activity [ 33 , 34 ]. These lower thiamin levels might be due to increases in clearance of thiamin by the kidneys. The relevance of these effects to clinical prognosis or outcomes is not known.\n",
    "People who have undergone bariatric surgery": "Bariatric surgery for weight loss is associated with some risks, including severe thiamin deficiency due to malabsorption that can lead to beriberi or Wernicke’s encephalopathy. A 2008 literature review identified 84 cases of Wernicke’s encephalopathy after bariatric surgery (primarily gastric bypass surgery) between 1991 and 2008 [ 35 ]. About half of these patients experienced long-lasting neurologic impairments. Micronutrient supplements that include thiamin are almost always recommended for patients following bariatric surgery to avoid deficiencies [ 36 ].\n",
    "Thiamin and Health": "This section focuses on four diseases or disorders in which thiamin does or might play a role: Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, diabetes, heart failure, and Alzheimer’s disease.\n",
    "Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome": "Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is one of the most severe neuropsychiatric sequelae of alcohol abuse [ 37 ]. The authors of a 2013 Cochrane Review of thiamin to treat or prevent Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome found only two studies that met their inclusion criteria, and one of these studies has not been published [ 37 ]. These randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials compared 5 mg/day by mouth for 2 weeks or daily intramuscular doses of 5 to 200 mg/day thiamin over 2 consecutive days in a total of 177 people with a history of chronic alcohol use. The Cochrane Review authors concluded that the evidence from randomized clinical trials is insufficient to guide health care providers in selecting the appropriate dose, frequency, duration, or route of thiamin supplementation to treat or prevent Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome in patients with alcohol abuse.\nThe authors of the European Federation of Neurological Societies guidelines for diagnosing, preventing, and treating Wernicke’s encephalopathy note that even high doses of oral thiamin supplements might not be effective in raising blood thiamin levels or curing Wernicke’s encephalopathy [ 38 ]. They recommend 200 mg thiamin, preferably intravenously, three times daily (total of 600 mg/day) until the signs and symptoms stop, along with a balanced diet. In its guidelines for managing Wernicke’s encephalopathy in emergency departments, the Royal College of Physicians in London supports the administration of oral thiamin hydrochloride (100 mg three times a day) in patients with adequate dietary intakes of thiamin and no signs or symptoms of Wernicke’s encephalopathy [ 39 ]. However, the authors recommend parenteral thiamin supplementation for patients at high risk, such as those with ataxia, confusion, and a history of chronic alcohol misuse, because oral supplementation is unlikely to produce adequate blood levels.\n",
    "Heart failure": "The rates of poor thiamin status in patients with heart failure have ranged in studies from 21% to 98% [ 47 ]. Explanations for this association include older age, comorbidities, insufficient dietary intake, treatment with diuretics, and frequent hospitalizations [ 48 ].\nThe authors of one study reported that 33% of 100 patients with chronic heart failure had thiamin deficiency compared to 12% of 50 healthy volunteers [ 49 ]. Rates of deficiency were even higher when the investigators excluded those who used thiamin supplements. The different rates of thiamin deficiency in patients with heart failure in these and other studies are probably due to differences in nutrition status, comorbidities, medications and dietary supplements used, and techniques used to measure thiamin status [ 48 ].\nThe authors of a systematic literature review and meta-analysis found two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of thiamin supplementation in people with heart failure that met their eligibility criteria [ 50 ]. In these trials, thiamin supplements significantly improved net change in left ventricular ejection fraction. The authors did not assess the clinical significance of this finding, however.\nMore research is needed to determine whether thiamin supplements might benefit people with heart failure, even if they have normal thiamin status.\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Thiamin": "The body excretes excess amounts of thiamin in the urine [ 2 ]. Because of the lack of reports of adverse effects from high thiamin intakes (50 mg/day or more) from food or supplements, the FNB did not establish ULs for thiamin [ 7 ]. They hypothesize that the apparent lack of toxicity may be explained by the rapid decline in absorption of thiamin at intakes above 5 mg. However, the FNB noted that in spite of the lack of reported adverse events, excessive intakes of thiamin could have adverse effects.\n",
    "Furosemide": "Furosemide (Lasix) is a loop diuretic used to treat edema and hypertension by increasing urinary output. Research has linked the use of furosemide to decreases in thiamin concentrations, possibly to deficient levels, as a result of urinary thiamin loss [ 49 , 58 , 59 ]. Whether thiamin supplements are effective for preventing thiamin deficiency in patients taking loop diuretics needs to be determined in clinical studies.\n",
    "Chemotherapy with fluorouracil": "Fluorouracil (also known as 5-fluorouracil; Adrucil) is a chemotherapy drug that is commonly used to treat colorectal and other solid cancers. The published literature includes several cases of beriberi or Wernicke’s encephalopathy resulting from treatment with this drug, possibly because the drug might increase thiamin metabolism and block the formation of TDP, the active form of thiamin [ 60-63 ]. Thiamin supplements might reverse some of these effects.\n",
    "Thiamin and Healthful Diets": "The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Many whole grains are good sources of thiamin, and yogurt contains thiamin. Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. ​​​​​​​Pork, fish, and seafood are good or high sources of thiamin. Beef, beans, and seeds contain thiamin. Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Limits alcoholic beverages. Stays within your daily calorie needs.\nMany whole grains are good sources of thiamin, and yogurt contains thiamin.\n​​​​​​​Pork, fish, and seafood are good or high sources of thiamin.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet .\n",
    "Introduction": "Vitamin A is the name of a group of fat-soluble retinoids, primarily retinol and retinyl esters [ 1 , 2 ]. Vitamin A is involved in immune function, cellular communication, growth and development, and male and female reproduction [ 1-3 ]. Vitamin A supports cell growth and differentiation, playing a critical role in the normal formation and maintenance of the heart, lungs, eyes, and other organs [ 1 , 2 ]. Vitamin A is also critical for vision as an essential component of rhodopsin, the light-sensitive protein in the retina that responds to light entering the eye, and because it supports the normal differentiation and functioning of the conjunctival membranes and cornea [ 2 , 4 ].\nThe human diet contains two sources for vitamin A: preformed vitamin A (retinol and retinyl esters) and provitamin A carotenoids [ 1 , 5 ]. Preformed vitamin A is found in foods from animal sources, including dairy products, eggs, fish, and organ meats [ 1 , 2 ]. Provitamin A carotenoids are plant pigments that include beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin [ 1 ]. The body converts provitamin A carotenoids into vitamin A in the intestine via the beta-carotene monooxygenase type 1 BCMO1 enzyme [ 1 , 3 , 6 ], although conversion rates may have genetic variability [ 7 , 8 , 9 ]. Other carotenoids in food, such as lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin, are not converted into vitamin A and are referred to as non-provitamin A carotenoids; they might have other important activities not involving vitamin A formation [ 1 ].\nThe various forms of vitamin A are solubilized into micelles in the intestinal lumen and absorbed by duodenal mucosal cells [ 5 ]. Retinyl esters and provitamin A carotenoids are converted to retinol after uptake into the lumen (for retinyl esters) or absorption (for provitamin A carotenoids). Retinol is then oxidized to retinal and retinoic acid, the two main active vitamin A metabolites in the body [ 1 ]. Most of the body’s vitamin A is stored in the liver in the form of retinyl esters [ 1 ].\nRetinol and carotenoid levels are typically measured in plasma or serum because blood samples are easy to collect [ 1 ]. However, these levels are not always reliable indicators of vitamin A status because they do not decline until vitamin A levels in the liver and other storage sites are almost depleted and because acute and chronic infections can decrease serum and plasma retinol concentrations [ 1 ]. Most vitamin A is stored in the liver, so measuring vitamin A levels in the liver is the best way to assess vitamin A adequacy [ 1 ]. In clinical studies, specialized research laboratories can measure liver vitamin A reserves indirectly using isotope-dilution or dose-response methods, in which plasma levels of retinol, a tracer surrogate, or both are measured over several days after the administration of vitamin A [ 1 ].\nIn clinical practice, plasma retinol levels alone can be used to document significant deficiency. A serum or plasma retinol concentration of 20 mcg/dL (0.70 micromoles/L) or less frequently reflects moderate vitamin A deficiency, and a level of 10 mcg/dL (0.35 micromoles/L) or less is considered an indicator of severe vitamin A deficiency [ 1 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for vitamin A and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [ 5 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nRDAs for vitamin A are given as retinol activity equivalents (RAE) to account for the different bioactivities of retinol and provitamin A carotenoids, all of which are converted by the body into retinol (see Table 1). One mcg RAE is equivalent to 1 mcg retinol, 2 mcg supplemental beta-carotene, 12 mcg dietary beta-carotene, or 24 mcg dietary alpha-carotene or beta-cryptoxanthin [ 5 ].\n*AI, equivalent to the mean intake of vitamin A in healthy, breastfed infants.\nThe units of measurement for vitamin A are now mcg RAE, but International Units (IUs) were previously used [ 10 ]. To convert IU to mcg RAE, use the following [ 11-13 ]:\n1 IU retinol = 0.3 mcg RAE 1 IU supplemental beta-carotene = 0.3 mcg RAE 1 IU dietary beta-carotene = 0.05 mcg RAE 1 IU dietary alpha-carotene or beta-cryptoxanthin = 0.025 mcg RAE\nRAE can only be directly converted into IUs if the sources of vitamin A are known. For example, the RDA of 900 mcg RAE for adolescent and adult men is equivalent to 3,000 IU if the food or supplement source is preformed vitamin A (retinol) or if the supplement source is beta-carotene. This RDA is also equivalent to 18,000 IU beta-carotene from food or to 36,000 IU alpha-carotene or beta-cryptoxanthin from food. Therefore, a mixed diet containing 900 mcg RAE provides between 3,000 and 36,000 IU vitamin A, depending on the foods consumed.\n",
    "Food": "Concentrations of preformed vitamin A are highest in liver, fish, eggs, and dairy products [ 1 ]. Most dietary provitamin A in the U.S. diet comes from leafy green vegetables, orange and yellow vegetables, tomato products, fruits, and some vegetable oils [ 1 , 5 , 14 ]. Vitamin A is routinely added to some foods, including milk and margarine [ 1 , 2 ]. Some ready-to-eat cereals are also fortified with vitamin A.\nAbout 65% to 80% of vitamin A consumed in the United States and other high-income countries comes from preformed vitamin A, whereas provitamin A is the main form consumed in low-income countries, where diets include more plant-based foods [ 2 , 15 ]. Among U.S. children and adolescents, enriched and fortified foods account for 34%–40% of vitamin A intakes from food [ 16 ].\nThe body might absorb up to 75% to 100% of retinol and, in most cases, 10% to 30% of beta-carotene from foods [ 17 , 18 ]. Cooking and heat treatment can increase the bioavailability of beta-carotene from foods [ 19 ].\nTable 2 lists a variety of foods and their vitamin A content per serving. The foods from animal sources in Table 2 contain primarily preformed vitamin A, the plant-based foods have provitamin A, and the foods with a mixture of ingredients from animals and plants contain both preformed vitamin A and provitamin A.\n*DV = Daily Value. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for vitamin A is 900 mcg RAE for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 11 ], where 1 mcg RAE = 1 mcg retinol, 2 mcg beta-carotene from supplements, 12 mcg beta-carotene from foods, 24 mcg alpha-carotene, or 24 mcg beta-cryptoxanthin. FDA does not require food labels to list vitamin A content unless vitamin A has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) FoodData Central lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing vitamin A arranged by nutrient content and by food name .\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "Vitamin A is available in stand-alone supplements and most multivitamins, often in the form of retinyl acetate, retinyl palmitate, provitamin A beta-carotene, or a combination [ 1 , 21 ]. Amounts of vitamin A in supplements vary widely, but 3,000 mcg RAE (333% of the DV) is common [ 21 ]. Multivitamins commonly have somewhat lower amounts, often 750 to 1,050 mcg RAE (83% to 117% of the DV).\nThe absorption of preformed vitamin A esters from dietary supplements is 70%–90%, and that of beta-carotene ranges from 8.7% to 65% [ 19 , 22 ].\n",
    "Vitamin A Intakes and Status": "Average daily intakes of vitamin A from foods and beverages in the United States were 682 mcg RAE for men age 20 and older and 616 mcg RAE for women in 2017–2018, according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) [ 23 ]. For children age 2–19, mean daily intakes of vitamin A from foods and beverages ranged from 497 to 680 mcg RAE. An analysis of biochemical data from 2003–2006 NHANES data indicates that less than 1% of the U.S. population has a serum retinol level of less than 20 mcg/dL, which indicates that vitamin A deficiency is uncommon in the U.S. population [ 24 ].\nData from NHANES III, conducted from 1988 to 1994, showed that approximately 26% of the vitamin A in RAEs consumed by men and 34% of that consumed by women in the United States comes from provitamin A carotenoids [ 5 ]. The remainder comes from preformed vitamin A, mostly in the form of retinyl esters.\nAbout 12% to 40% of the U.S. population, depending on age, uses supplements containing vitamin A [ 25 ]. Adults age 71 years or older and children younger than 9 are more likely than members of other age groups to take supplements containing vitamin A.\n",
    "Vitamin A Deficiency": "Frank vitamin A deficiency is rare in the United States. However, vitamin A deficiency is still common in many developing countries, often as a result of limited access to foods containing preformed vitamin A from animal-based food sources and to foods containing provitamin A carotenoids because of poverty or traditional diets [ 1 , 26 ]. A pooled analysis of population-based surveys from 138 low-income and middle-income countries found that 29% of children age 6 months to 5 years had vitamin A deficiency in 2013 [ 27 ]. Deficiency rates were highest in sub-Saharan Africa (48%) and South Asia (44%). In addition, approximately 10% to 20% of pregnant women in low-income countries have vitamin A deficiency [ 28 ].\nLimited research suggests that vitamin A deficiency may also be influenced by genetic variability in conversion rates of beta-carotene to vitamin A. Certain polymorphisms in the BCMO1 gene have been found to reduce the activity of the BCMO1 enzyme in humans [ 8 , 9 ], and a study in the Philippines among 693 children and adolescents found an inverse association between vitamin A status and the A379V TT variant in the BCMO1 gene [ 7 ].\nThe most common clinical sign of vitamin A deficiency is xerophthalmia, which develops after plasma retinol has been low and the eye’s vitamin A reserves have become depleted. The first sign is night blindness, or the inability to see in low light or darkness as a result of low rhodopsin levels in the retina [ 1 , 27 , 28 ]. Xerophthalmia also affects the cornea and can eventually lead to permanent blindness; vitamin A deficiency is one of the top causes of preventable blindness in children [ 28 ].\nChronic vitamin A deficiency has also been associated with abnormal lung development, respiratory diseases (such as pneumonia), and an increased risk of anemia and death [ 26 , 27 , 29 ].\nAnother effect of chronic vitamin A deficiency is increased severity and mortality risk of infections (particularly measles and infection-associated diarrhea) [ 26 ]. In 2013, 94,500 children in low-income and middle-income countries died of diarrhea and 11,200 died of measles as a result of vitamin A deficiency [ 27 ]. More than 95% of deaths attributable to vitamin A deficiency occurred in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, where vitamin A deficiency was responsible for 2% of all deaths in children younger than 5 years [ 27 ].\n",
    "Groups at Risk of Vitamin A Inadequacy": "The following groups are among those most likely to have inadequate intakes of vitamin A.\n",
    "Premature infants": "Preterm infants have low liver stores of vitamin A at birth, and their plasma concentrations of retinol often remain low throughout the first year of life [ 30 , 31 ]. Preterm infants with vitamin A deficiency have a higher risk of eye and chronic lung diseases [ 32 , 33 ]. However, in high-income countries, clinical vitamin A deficiency is rare in infants and occurs only in those with malabsorption disorders [ 34 ].\n",
    "Infants, children, and pregnant and lactating women in low-income and middle-income countries": "Pregnant women need extra vitamin A for fetal growth and tissue maintenance and to support their own metabolism [ 35-37 ]. The breast milk of lactating women with adequate vitamin A intakes contains sufficient amounts of vitamin A to meet infants’ needs for the first 6 months of life [ 38 ]. However, in people with vitamin A deficiency, the vitamin A content of breast milk is not sufficient to maintain adequate vitamin A stores in infants who are exclusively breastfed [ 38 ].\nAbout 190 million preschool-age children (one-third of all children in this age group), mostly in Africa and Southeast Asia, have vitamin A deficiency, according to the World Health Organization [ 27 , 39 ]. They have a higher risk of visual impairment and of illness and death from childhood infections, such as measles and infections that cause diarrheal diseases [ 1 , 39 ].\nThe World Health Organization estimates that 9.8 million pregnant women (15% of all pregnant women) around the world, mostly in low-income and middle-income countries, have xerophthalmia as a result of vitamin A deficiency [ 40 ].\n",
    "People with cystic fibrosis": "Up to 90% of people with cystic fibrosis have pancreatic insufficiency, which increases their risk of vitamin A deficiency due to difficulty absorbing fat [ 1 , 41 ]. Studies in Australia and the Netherlands indicate that 2% to 13% of children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis have vitamin A deficiency [ 42 , 43 ]. As a result, standard care for cystic fibrosis includes lifelong treatment with vitamin A (daily amounts of 750 mcg RAE to 3,000 mcg RAE, depending on age, are recommended in the United States and Australia), other fat-soluble vitamins, and pancreatic enzymes [ 41 , 43 ].\n",
    "Individuals with gastrointestinal disorders": "Approximately one-quarter of children with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis have vitamin A deficiency; adults with these disorders, especially those who have had the disorder for several years, also have a higher risk of vitamin A deficiency [ 44 , 45 ]. Although some evidence supports the use of vitamin A supplements in people with these disorders [ 46 ], other research has found that supplementation offers no benefit [ 47 ]. Some children and adults with newly diagnosed celiac disease also have vitamin A deficiency; a gluten-free diet can, but does not always, eliminate this deficiency [ 48-51 ].\n",
    "Vitamin A and Health": "This section focuses on three diseases and disorders in which vitamin A or carotenoids might play a role: cancer, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and measles.\n",
    "Cancer": "Because of its role in regulating cell growth and differentiation, several studies have examined the association between vitamin A and various types of cancer. However, the relationship between serum vitamin A levels or vitamin A supplementation and cancer risk or cancer-related death is unclear. This fact sheet does not include studies of all-trans retinoic acid, a vitamin A metabolite that is used as a drug in high doses to treat a form of leukemia [ 52 , 53 ].\nSeveral systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies have shown that higher dietary intakes of retinol, carotenoids, fruits and vegetables, or a combination are associated with a lower risk of lung cancer [ 54 ], non-Hodgkin lymphoma [ 55 ], pancreatic cancer [ 56 ], oral cavity cancer [ 57 ], laryngeal cancer [ 57 ], esophageal cancer [ 58 ], ovarian cancer [ 59 , 60 ], glioma [ 61 ], and bladder cancer [ 62 ]. However, other observational studies have found no association between intakes of different forms of vitamin A and risk of liver cancer [ 63 ], non-Hodgkin lymphoma [ 64 ], colorectal cancer [ 65 ], prostate cancer [ 65 ], or all cancers [ 66 ].\nSome clinical trial evidence suggests that supplemental vitamin A might reduce the risk of certain cancers but increase the risk of other forms of cancer, cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality, and all-cause mortality. Examples are provided below.\nThe Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) included 18,314 male and female current and former smokers (with at least a 20 pack-year history [equivalent to smoking 1 pack per day for 20 years or 2 packs per day for 10 years, for example] of cigarette smoking) as well as some men occupationally exposed to asbestos (who also have a higher risk of lung cancer), all age 45–74 years. The study randomized participants to take supplements containing 30 mg beta-carotene plus 25,000 IU (7,500 mcg RAE) retinyl palmitate or a placebo daily for about 6 years to evaluate the potential effects on lung cancer risk [ 67 ]. The trial was ended prematurely after a mean of 4 years, partly because the supplements were unexpectedly found to have increased lung cancer risk by 28% and death from lung cancer by 46%; the supplements also increased the risk of all-cause mortality by 17%.\nA subsequent study followed CARET participants for an additional 6 years after they stopped taking the study supplements [ 68 ]. During this time, the differences in lung cancer risk between the intervention and placebo groups were no longer statistically significant, with one exception: women in the intervention group had a 33% higher risk of lung cancer. In a separate analysis of CARET study data, men who took the two supplements had a 35% lower risk of nonaggressive prostate cancer during the 4-year active trial but not during the 6-year postintervention period. In contrast, men who took these two supplements in addition to another self-prescribed supplement (typically a multivitamin) had a 52% higher risk of aggressive prostate cancer during the active trial, but not during the postintervention period [ 69 ].\nThe Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene (ATBC) Cancer Prevention Study also found that beta-carotene supplements increased the risk of lung cancer in smokers [ 70 ]. In this study, 29,133 male smokers age 50–69 years who smoked an average of 20.4 cigarettes a day for an average of 35.9 years took a supplement containing 50 mg/day alpha-tocopherol, 20 mg/day beta-carotene, both alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene, or a placebo for 5–8 years. The beta-carotene supplements increased the risk of lung cancer by 18%, although they had little to no effect on the incidence of other cancers. The overall rate of death, primarily from lung cancer and ischemic heart disease, was 8% higher in participants who took beta-carotene. A subsequent study followed 25,563 of these participants for an additional 18 years [ 71 ]. During this period, participants were no longer taking the supplements, but most continued to smoke. Participants who had taken beta-carotene in the original trial did not have a higher risk of lung cancer, but they had a 20% higher risk of death due to prostate cancer.\nThe Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) was a 5-year randomized clinical trial with 4,203 participants age 50–85 years examining the effects on AMD of a dietary supplement containing several ingredients with or without beta-carotene (15 mg [7,500 mcg RAE]) [ 72 ]. No current smokers received the supplements containing beta-carotene. At the end of the trial, more lung cancers were discovered in the beta-carotene group than in the no beta-carotene group (23 vs. 11 cases), and 31 of the 34 affected were former smokers. In a follow-up analysis of 3,882 of the participants 5 years after the end of AREDS2 (during which they took the AREDS2 formulation containing lutein and zeaxanthin instead of beta-carotene), the increased lung cancer risk persisted, with an 82% higher risk among participants who took the supplement containing beta-carotene during the 5-year AREDS2 trial [ 73 ].\nThree other clinical trials have found no relationship between taking vitamin A or beta-carotene supplements and lung cancer incidence or mortality [ 74 ]. One trial randomized 22,071 male physicians age 40–84 years to take 50 mg beta carotene on alternate days or a placebo for 12 years [ 75 ]. Eleven percent of the physicians were current smokers, and 38% were former smokers at the start of the study. The results showed no differences between the groups in number of cases of lung cancer or any malignant neoplasms or number of deaths from cancer. Another trial randomized 7,627 women (mean age 60.4 years) to take 50 mg beta-carotene on alternate days, 600 IU vitamin E on alternate days, 500 mg vitamin C daily, or a placebo for a mean of 9.4 years [ 76 ]. Fifteen percent of the women were current smokers, and 41% were former smokers at the start of the study. None of the supplements had any significant effect on total cancer incidence or cancer mortality, including from lung cancer. A third trial included 29,584 healthy men and women age 40–69 years who were living in Linxian, China, where micronutrient deficiencies are common [ 77 ]. The study randomized participants to take either a placebo or one of four vitamin and mineral combinations (including one providing retinol and zinc and another providing beta carotene, vitamin E, and selenium) for 5.25 years. The investigators followed participants for an additional 10 years after they stopped taking the supplements. The nutrient doses in the supplements were equivalent to or twice as high as U.S. recommended intakes, but the study report did not provide the exact doses. During both the intervention and follow-up periods, lung cancer death rates did not differ among the five groups, even when the investigators further analyzed the results for differences by age, sex, and smoking status.\nThe CARET and ATBC study results suggest that large supplemental doses of beta-carotene with or without retinyl palmitate have detrimental effects in current or former smokers and workers exposed to asbestos. However, the other studies described above that used similar vitamin A doses but had smaller proportions of current or former smokers do not raise this concern. Among nonsmokers, beta-carotene and vitamin A supplements do not appear to affect the risk of cancer.\n",
    "Age-related macular degeneration": "AMD is the leading cause of significant vision loss in older people [ 78 ]. AMD’s etiology involves complex interactions among genetic susceptibility, environmental factors (including exposure to oxidative stress), and normal aging [ 78 ]. Because of the role of oxidative stress in AMD pathophysiology, supplements containing carotenoids with antioxidant functions, such as beta-carotene, lutein, and zeaxanthin, might be useful for preventing or treating this condition. Lutein and zeaxanthin (which are not precursors of vitamin A), in particular, accumulate in the retina, the tissue in the eye that is damaged by AMD.\nThe AREDS trial found that participants with a high risk of developing advanced AMD (i.e., those who had intermediate AMD or who had advanced AMD in one eye) had a 25% lower risk of developing advanced AMD after they took a daily supplement containing beta-carotene (15 mg [7,500 mcg RAE]), vitamin E (180 mg [400 IU] dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate), vitamin C (500 mg), zinc (80 mg), and copper (2 mg) for 5 years than participants taking a placebo [ 79 ].\nThe follow-up AREDS2 study confirmed the value of this supplement in reducing the progression of AMD over a median follow-up period of 5 years [ 72 ]. However, this follow-up study showed that adding lutein (10 mg) and zeaxanthin (2 mg) or omega-3 fatty acids to the formulation produced no additional benefits. Importantly, the follow-up study also revealed that beta-carotene was not a required ingredient; the original AREDS formulation without beta-carotene provided the same protective effect against developing advanced AMD.\nIn a more detailed analysis, participants with the lowest dietary intakes of lutein and zeaxanthin had a 26% lower risk of advanced AMD when they took a supplement containing these two carotenoids than those who did not take a supplement with these carotenoids [ 72 ]. The risk of advanced AMD was also 18% lower in participants who took the modified AREDS supplement containing lutein and zeaxanthin but not beta-carotene than in participants who took the formulation with beta-carotene but not lutein or zeaxanthin.\nA subsequent study monitored dietary intakes of several nutrients in 4,504 AREDS participants and 3,738 AREDS2 participants (mean age 71 years) for a median of 10.2 years [ 80 ]. Participants in the two highest quintiles of intakes for vitamin A, beta-carotene, or lutein and zeaxanthin had a lower risk of progression to late AMD. For example, the risk of late AMD was 18% lower among those in the fifth quintile for vitamin A intake and 20% lower among those in the fourth quintile than among those in the first quintile.\nAt the end of the 5-year AREDS2 trial, participants were all offered the final AREDS2 formulation that included lutein and zeaxanthin in place of beta-carotene. Researchers followed up with 3,882 of these participants for an additional 5 years [ 73 ]. After 10 years, participants who had taken the AREDS2 supplement with lutein and zeaxanthin had an additional 20% reduced risk of progression to late AMD compared with those who took the supplement containing beta-carotene. This finding confirmed the benefit of replacing beta-carotene with lutein and zeaxanthin.\nIndividuals who have or are developing AMD should talk to their health care provider about their vitamin A intakes and the supplement formulations used in the AREDS studies.\n",
    "Measles": "In 2023, measles was responsible for about 107,500 deaths worldwide, mostly in young children in low-income countries [ 81 , 82 ]. Vitamin A deficiency, which is rare in the United States, is a risk factor for severe measles [ 27 , 83 ]. A World Health Organization analysis of data from 83 countries showed that 11,200 child deaths from measles were associated with vitamin A deficiency in 2013, and more than 95% of these deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia [ 27 ].\nResearch suggests that vitamin A supplementation reduces the risk of measles in children who are at high risk of vitamin A deficiency. However, vitamin A supplementation does not appear to reduce the risk of death from measles. A 2022 Cochrane Review included six clinical trials that examined the effect of vitamin A supplementation on the risk of measles in children [ 84 ]. These studies enrolled a total of 19,566 children age 6 months to 5 years who lived in low- and middle-income countries. Vitamin A doses ranged from 15,000 mcg RAE (50,000 IU) to 60,000 mcg RAE (200,000 IU), depending on age. Supplements were administered as a single dose or every 4 to 6 months. Vitamin A supplementation reduced the risk of new cases of measles by 50%. However, the same Cochrane Review found that vitamin A supplementation did not affect the risk of death due to measles, based on the results from six clinical trials in a total of 1,088,261 children.\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Vitamin A": "Because vitamin A is fat soluble, the body stores excess amounts, primarily in the liver, and these levels can accumulate.\nAcute vitamin A toxicity, also referred to as hypervitaminosis A, occurs within days to weeks after someone ingests one or a few very high doses (typically more than 100 times the RDA) [ 85 ]. Resulting signs and symptoms typically include severe headache, blurred vision, nausea, dizziness, aching muscles, and coordination problems. In severe cases, cerebral spinal fluid pressure can increase, leading to drowsiness and, eventually, coma and even death [ 85 ].\nChronic hypervitaminosis A (regular consumption of high doses) can cause dry skin, painful muscles and joints, fatigue, depression, and abnormal liver test results [ 85 ].\nTotal intakes of preformed vitamin A that exceed the UL as well as some retinoid medications used as topical therapies (such as isotretinoin, used to treat severe acne, and etretinate, a treatment for severe psoriasis) can cause congenital birth defects [ 1 ]. These birth defects can include malformations of the eye, skull, lungs, and heart [ 14 ]. Experts advise women who are or might be pregnant and those who are lactating not to take high doses (more than 3,000 mcg RAE [10,000 IU] daily) of vitamin A supplements [ 1 ].\nUnlike preformed vitamin A, beta-carotene is not known to be teratogenic or lead to reproductive toxicity [ 1 ]. The most common effect of long-term, excess beta-carotene is carotenodermia, a harmless condition in which the skin becomes yellow-orange [ 3 ]. This condition can be reversed by discontinuing beta-carotene ingestion. However, the ATBC trial found that supplementation with a large amount of beta-carotene (20 mg/day), with or without 50 mg/day vitamin E, for 5–8 years increased the risk of lung cancer and mortality (mainly from lung cancer and ischemic heart disease) in male smokers [ 70 ]. The CARET trial also showed that supplementation with a large amount of beta-carotene (30 mg/day) plus 7,500 mcg RAE (25,000 IU)/day retinyl palmitate for 4–8 years in current and former smokers as well as some men occupationally exposed to asbestos increased the risk of lung cancer and death from lung cancer [ 67 ].\nThe FNB has not established ULs for beta-carotene and other provitamin A carotenoids [ 3 ]. However, the FNB advises against the use of beta-carotene supplements for the general population, except as a provitamin A source to prevent vitamin A deficiency.\n",
    "Tolerable upper intake levels for preformed vitamin A": "The FNB has established ULs for preformed vitamin A that apply to both food and supplement intakes [ 5 ]. The FNB based these ULs on the amounts associated with an increased risk of liver abnormalities in men and women, teratogenic effects, and several toxic effects in infants and children.\n*These ULs apply only to products from animal sources and supplements whose vitamin A comes entirely from retinol or its ester forms, such as retinyl palmitate. However, many dietary supplements (such as multivitamins) do not provide all of their vitamin A in retinol or its ester forms. For example, the vitamin A in some supplements consists partly or entirely of beta-carotene. In such cases, the percentage of retinol or retinyl ester in the supplement should be used to determine whether an individual’s vitamin A intake exceeds the UL. For example, a supplement whose label indicates that the product contains 3,000 mcg RAE vitamin A and that 60% of this vitamin A comes from beta-carotene (and therefore 40% comes from retinol or retinyl ester) provides 1,200 mcg RAE of preformed vitamin A. That amount is above the UL for children from birth to 8 years but below the UL for older children and adults.\n",
    "Interactions with Medications": "Vitamin A has the potential to interact with certain medications. In addition, several types of medications might adversely affect vitamin A levels. A few examples are provided below. Individuals taking these and other medications on a regular basis should discuss their vitamin A status with their health care providers.\nOrlistat (Alli, Xenical), a weight-loss treatment, can decrease the absorption of vitamin A, other fat-soluble vitamins, and beta-carotene, resulting in low plasma levels in some patients [ 86 , 87 ]. The manufacturers of Alli and Xenical recommend that patients on orlistat take a multivitamin supplement containing vitamin A and beta-carotene as well as other fat-soluble vitamins [ 88 , 89 ].\n",
    "Retinoids": "Several synthetic retinoids derived from vitamin A are used orally as prescription medicines. Examples include the psoriasis treatment acitretin (Soriatane) and bexarotene (Targretin), used to treat the skin effects of T-cell lymphoma. Retinoids can increase the risk of hypervitaminosis A when taken in combination with vitamin A supplements [ 87 ].\n",
    "Vitamin A and Healthful Diets": "The federal government’s 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate .\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy eating pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products, and oils. Many fruits, vegetables, and dairy products are good sources of vitamin A. Some ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are fortified with vitamin A. Includes a variety of protein foods, including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans and peas), nuts, seeds, and soy products. Beef liver contains high amounts of vitamin A. Other sources of the nutrient include eggs and some fish. Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Limits alcoholic beverages. Stays within your daily calorie needs.\nMany fruits, vegetables, and dairy products are good sources of vitamin A. Some ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are fortified with vitamin A.\nBeef liver contains high amounts of vitamin A. Other sources of the nutrient include eggs and some fish.\n",

    "Introduction": "Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in some foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement and a prescription medication. Because vitamin B12 contains the mineral cobalt, compounds with vitamin B12 activity are collectively called cobalamins [ 1 ]. Methylcobalamin and 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin are the metabolically active forms of vitamin B12. However, two others forms, hydroxycobalamin and cyanocobalamin, become biologically active after they are converted to methylcobalamin or 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin [ 1-3 ].\nVitamin B12 is required for the development, myelination, and function of the central nervous system; healthy red blood cell formation; and DNA synthesis [ 1 , 4 , 5 ]. Vitamin B12 functions as a cofactor for two enzymes, methionine synthase and L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase [ 1-3 , 5 ]. Methionine synthase catalyzes the conversion of homocysteine to the essential amino acid methionine [ 1 , 2 ]. Methionine is required for the formation of S-adenosylmethionine, a universal methyl donor for almost 100 different substrates, including DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids [ 3 , 5 ]. L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase converts L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA in the metabolism of propionate, a short-chain fatty acid [ 2 ].\nVitamin B12 is bound to protein in food and must be released before it is absorbed [ 5 ]. The process starts in the mouth when food is mixed with saliva. The freed vitamin B12 then binds with haptocorrin, a cobalamin-binding protein in the saliva. More vitamin B12 is released from its food matrix by the activity of hydrochloric acid and gastric protease in the stomach, where it then binds to haptocorrin [ 1 ]. In the duodenum, digestive enzymes free the vitamin B12 from haptocorrin, and this freed vitamin B12 combines with intrinsic factor, a transport and delivery binding protein secreted by the stomach’s parietal cells. The resulting complex is absorbed in the distal ileum by receptor-mediated endocytosis [ 1 , 5 ]. If vitamin B12 is added to fortified foods and dietary supplements, it is already in free form and therefore does not require the separation step.\nVitamin B12 status is typically assessed by measurements of serum or plasma vitamin B12 levels. The cutoff between normal vitamin B12 levels and deficiency varies by method and laboratory, but most laboratories define subnormal serum or plasma values as those lower than 200 or 250 pg/mL (148 or 185 pmol/L) [ 2 ]. Levels of serum methylmalonic acid (MMA), a vitamin B12-associated metabolite, are the most sensitive markers of vitamin B12 status, and an MMA level greater than 0.271 micromol/L suggests vitamin B12 deficiency [ 6-8 ]. However, MMA levels also rise with renal insufficiency and tend to be higher in older adults [ 6 , 9 , 10 ]. Another marker is total plasma homocysteine levels, which rise quickly as vitamin B12 status declines; a serum homocysteine level higher than 15 micromol/L, for example, suggests vitamin B12 deficiency [ 11 ]. However, this indicator has poor specificity because it is influenced by other factors, such as low folate levels and, especially, by declines in kidney function [ 6 ]. Experts suggest that if a patient’s serum vitamin B12 level is between 150 to 399 pg/mL (111 to 294 pmol/L), the patient’s serum MMA levels should be checked to help confirm a diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency [ 7 , 9 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for vitamin B12 and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [ 1 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nTable 1 lists the current RDAs for vitamin B12 [ 1 ]. For adults, the main criterion that the FNB used to establish the RDAs was the amount needed to maintain a healthy hematological status and serum vitamin B12 levels. For infants age 0 to 12 months, the FNB established an AI that is equivalent to the mean intake of vitamin B12 in healthy, breastfed infants.\n* Adequate Intake (AI)\n",
    "Food": "Vitamin B12 is present in foods of animal origin, including fish, meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy products [ 5 , 12 ].\nPlant foods do not naturally contain vitamin B12. However, fortified breakfast cereals and fortified nutritional yeasts are readily available sources of vitamin B12 that have high bioavailability [ 13 , 14 ].\nThe average vitamin B12 level in the breast milk of women with vitamin B12 intakes above the RDA is 0.44 mcg/L [ 15 ]. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specifies that infant formulas sold in the United States must provide at least 0.15 mcg vitamin B12 per 100 kcal [ 16 ].\nThe estimated bioavailability of vitamin B12 from food varies by vitamin B12 dose because absorption decreases drastically when the capacity of intrinsic factor is exceeded (at 1–2 mcg of vitamin B12) [ 17 ]. Bioavailability also varies by type of food source. For example, the bioavailability of vitamin B12 appears to be about three times higher in dairy products than in meat, fish, and poultry, and the bioavailability of vitamin B12 from dietary supplements is about 50% higher than that from food sources [ 18-20 ].\nA variety of foods and their vitamin B12 levels per serving are listed in Table 2.\n*DV = Daily Value. FDA developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for vitamin B12 is 2.4 mcg for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 22 ]. FDA does not require food labels to list vitamin B12 content unless vitamin B12 has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA's) FoodData Central [ 21 ] lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing vitamin B12 arranged by nutrient content and by food name.\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "Vitamin B12 is available in multivitamin/mineral supplements, in supplements containing other B-complex vitamins, and in supplements containing only vitamin B12. Multivitamin/mineral supplements typically contain vitamin B12 at doses ranging from 5 to 25 mcg [ 23 ]. Vitamin B12 levels are higher, generally 50–500 mcg, in supplements containing vitamin B12 with other B-complex vitamins and even higher, typically 500–1,000 mcg, in supplements containing only vitamin B12.\nThe most common form of vitamin B12 in dietary supplements is cyanocobalamin [ 1 , 3 , 23 , 24 ]. Other forms of vitamin B12 in supplements are adenosylcobalamin, methylcobalamin, and hydroxycobalamin [ 23 ].\nNo evidence indicates that absorption rates of vitamin B12 in supplements vary by form of the vitamin. These rates are about 50% at doses (less than 1–2 mcg) that do not exceed the cobalamin-binding capacity of intrinsic factor and are substantially lower at doses well above 1–2 mcg [ 24 , 25 ]. For example, absorption is only about 2% at doses of 500 mcg and 1.3% at doses of 1,000 mcg [ 25 ].\nIn addition to oral dietary supplements, vitamin B12 is available in sublingual preparations as tablets or lozenges [ 23 ]. Evidence suggests no difference in efficacy between oral and sublingual forms [ 26 , 27 ].\n",

However, although rates of vitamin B12 deficiency are higher in people with celiac disease than other people [ 50 ], the evidence for whether rates of vitamin B12 deficiency are higher in people with Crohn’s disease is mixed [ 49 , 51 , 52 ]. Vitamin B12 deficiency in people with Crohn’s disease is typically treated with intramuscular cobalamin injections, but high doses of oral cyanocobalamin therapy (e.g., 1,000 mcg/day) might be equally effective [ 53 ].\n",
    "Vitamin A and Health": NaN,
    "Cancer": "The evidence for a relationship between vitamin B12 and cancer risk is mixed. Some evidence supports a link between increased cancer risk and higher intakes or blood concentrations of vitamin B12, some supports a link with lower intakes or concentrations, and some evidence indicates no link at all.\nObservational evidence supporting an association between higher vitamin B12 levels and increased cancer risk includes an analysis of data on 757,185 people (median age 56 years) with plasma vitamin B12 measurements [ 60 ]. The results showed that the adjusted 1-year risk of cancer was 1.74 to 4.72 times higher among those with vitamin B12 levels above 813 pg/mL (600 pmol/L) than those with levels in the normal range of 203–813 pg/mL (150–600 pmol/L). An analysis by some of the same investigators of data from Danish medical registries for 25,017 people who had a cancer diagnosis between 1998 and 2014 found 1-year survival rates of 35.8% in those whose plasma cobalamin levels were higher than 1,084 pg/mL (800 pmol/L) and 69.3% in those with levels between 271 and 813 pg/mL (200–600 pmol/L) [ 61 ].\nSome observational evidence also shows an association between supplements containing vitamin B12 and a higher risk of certain types of cancer. For example, an assessment of 77,118 participants age 50 to 76 years in the Vitamins and Lifestyle cohort study found that use of at least 55 mcg/day supplemental vitamin B12 for an average of 10 years was associated with a 40% higher risk of lung cancer in men [ 62 ]. However, the study found no association between supplemental vitamin B12 use and cancer risk in women.\nLimited clinical trial evidence supports the finding that higher vitamin B12 intakes might increase cancer risk. In an analysis of data on 2,524 participants in the B Vitamins for the Prevention of Osteoporotic Fractures trial who were treated with supplements containing 400 mcg/day folic acid and 500 mcg/day vitamin B12 for 2 to 3 years, the risk of colorectal cancer was significantly higher, at 3.4%, in the supplementation group than in the placebo group, whose rate was 2% [ 63 ]. However, high folic acid levels are potentially linked to increased risk of colorectal cancer, so the result might be due to the folic acid rather than the vitamin B12 [ 64 ]. Furthermore, the supplements had no significant effect on overall cancer risk.\nSome observational evidence shows no association between high vitamin B12 concentrations or intakes and increased risk of certain cancers. For example, higher vitamin B12 intakes or serum concentrations were not associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer [ 65 ], breast cancer [ 66 ], or esophageal cancer or gastric cancer [ 67 ]. Clinical trials support the lack of association between higher vitamin B12 intakes and cancer risk. [ 68-70 ]. For example, a meta-analysis of 18 RCTs that included 74,498 individuals found that supplements containing B vitamins, including 20 to 2,000 mcg/day vitamin B12, had little or no effect on cancer incidence, cancer deaths, or all-cause mortality during follow-up periods of 2 to 7.3 years [ 70 ].\nFinally, evidence pointing to an association between lower vitamin B12 levels and a higher cancer risk includes observational data showing a risk of gastric cancer that was 5.8 times higher in male smokers with lower vitamin B12 levels (less than 394 pg/mL [291 pmol/L]) than in those with levels higher than 591 pg/mL (436 pmol/L) [ 71 ]. Also, two meta-analyses found associations between lower vitamin B12 concentrations or intakes and a higher risk of colorectal cancer [ 72 ] and prostate cancer [ 73 ].\nMore evidence is needed to clarify whether high or low intakes of vitamin B12 influence the risk of cancer as well as the role of vitamin B12 in preventing cancer.\n",

    "Prescription medications": "Vitamin B12, in the forms of cyanocobalamin and hydroxycobalamin, can be administered parenterally as a prescription medication, usually by intramuscular injection [ 2 ]. Parenteral administration is typically used to treat vitamin B12 deficiency caused by pernicious anemia as well as other conditions (e.g., tropical sprue, pancreatic insufficiency) that result in vitamin B12 malabsorption and severe vitamin B12 deficiency [ 5 ].\nVitamin B12 is also available as a prescription nasal gel spray. This formulation appears to be effective in raising vitamin B12 blood levels in adults and children [ 28 , 29 ]. A small clinical study with 10 participants (mean age 81 years) found that the bioavailability of a 1,000 mcg cobalamin dose was 2% with intranasal administration, which is similar to the bioavailability of an oral dose [ 30 ].\n",
    "Vitamin B12 Intakes and Status": "Most people in the United States consume adequate amounts of vitamin B12. Data from the 2017–March 2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) show that mean daily intakes of vitamin B12 from food and beverages were 5.84 mcg for men age 20 and older and 3.69 mcg for women [ 31 ]. For children and adolescents age 2 to 19, mean daily intakes of vitamin B12 ranged from 3.66 mcg to 4.52 mcg [ 31 ]. Only 5% of U.S. men and 11% of women had intakes from food and beverages below the vitamin B12 EAR of 2 mcg [ 32 ]. People of low socioeconomic status, women, and non-Hispanic Blacks are most likely to have low vitamin B12 intakes [ 33 ].\nApproximately 24% of men and 29% of women reported using a dietary supplement containing vitamin B12 in NHANES 2017–March 2020 [ 32 ]. The proportion in children and adolescents ranged from 28% of those age 2 to 5 years to 9% of those age 12 to 19. Mean daily vitamin B12 intakes among supplement users from food, beverages, and supplements were 297.3 mcg for men age 20 and older, 407.4 mcg for women, and from 24.7 to 47.4 mcg for children and adolescents.\nAccording to an analysis of NHANES data from 2007–2018, approximately 3.6% of all adults age 19 and older have vitamin B12 deficiency (assessed as serum vitamin B12 <200 pg/mL [148 pmol/L]), and the rate is 3.7% in those age 60 and older [ 34 ]. However, vitamin B12 insufficiency (assessed as serum vitamin B12 <300 pg/mL [221 pmol/L]) is more prevalent, affecting approximately 12.5% of all adults age 19 and older, and 12.3% of those age 60 and older [ 34 ]. During pregnancy, serum vitamin B12 levels tend to drop, sometimes to subnormal levels, but they usually return to normal after delivery [ 35 ].\n",
    "Vitamin B12 Deficiency": "Causes of vitamin B12 deficiency include difficulty absorbing vitamin B12 from food, lack of intrinsic factor (e.g., because of pernicious anemia), surgery in the gastrointestinal tract, prolonged use of certain medications (e.g., metformin or proton pump inhibitors, discussed in more detail below in the section on interactions with medications), and dietary deficiency [ 5 , 7 ]. Because people who have difficulty absorbing vitamin B12 from food absorb free vitamin B12 normally, their vitamin B12 deficiency tends to be less severe than that of individuals with pernicious anemia, who cannot absorb either food-bound or free vitamin B12. Certain congenital conditions, such as hereditary intrinsic factor defects and congenital vitamin B12 malabsorption (Imerslund-Gräsbeck disease), can also cause severe vitamin B12 deficiency [ 5 ].\nThe effects of vitamin B12 deficiency can include the hallmark megaloblastic anemia (characterized by large, abnormally nucleated red blood cells) as well as low counts of white and red blood cells, platelets, or a combination; glossitis of the tongue; fatigue; palpitations; pale skin; dementia; weight loss; and infertility [ 2 , 5 , 7 ]. Neurological changes, such as numbness and tingling in the hands and feet, can also occur [ 7 ]. These neurological symptoms can occur without anemia, so early diagnosis and intervention is important to avoid irreversible damage [ 36 ]. In addition, some studies have found associations between vitamin B12 deficiency or low vitamin B12 intakes and depression [ 37-39 ]. In pregnant and breastfeeding women, vitamin B12 deficiency might cause neural tube defects, developmental delays, failure to thrive, and anemia in offspring [ 7 ].\nBecause the body stores about 1 to 5 mg vitamin B12 (or about 1,000 to 2,000 times as much as the amount typically consumed in a day), the symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency can take several years to appear [ 7 , 40 ].\nVitamin B12 deficiency with the classic hematologic and neurologic signs and symptoms is uncommon [ 11 ]. However, low or marginal vitamin B12 status (200–300 pg/mL [148–221 pmol/L]) without these symptoms is much more common, at up to 40% in Western populations, especially in those with low intakes of vitamin B12-rich foods [ 9 , 11 ]. The prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency varies by cutoff level and biomarker used. For example, among adults age 19 and older who participated in NHANES between 1999 and 2004, the rate of low vitamin B12 levels in serum was 3% with a cutoff of less than 200 pg/mL (148 pmol/L) and 26% with a cutoff of less than 350 pg/mL (258 pmol/L) [ 39 ]. Approximately 21% of adults older than 60 had abnormal levels of at least one vitamin B12 biomarker [ 41 ].\nTypically, vitamin B12 deficiency is treated with vitamin B12 injections because this method bypasses any barriers to absorption. However, high doses of oral vitamin B12 might also be effective. A 2018 Cochrane Review included three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared very high doses (1,000–2,000 mcg) of oral with intramuscular vitamin B12 for vitamin B12 deficiency in a total of 153 participants [ 42 ]. The evidence from these studies, although of low quality, showed that the ability of high oral doses of vitamin B12 supplements to normalize serum vitamin B12 was similar to that of intramuscular vitamin B12.\n",
    "Groups at Risk of Vitamin B12 Inadequacy": "The following groups are among those most likely to be vitamin B12 deficient.\n",
    "Older adults": "Depending on the definition used, between 3% and 43% of community-dwelling older adults, especially those with atrophic gastritis, have vitamin B12 deficiency based on serum vitamin B12 levels [ 43 , 44 ]. The deficiency rate at a cutoff of less than 211 pg/mL (156 pmol/L) at admission to a long-term care facility, according to one study, was 14%, and 38% of these older adults had levels lower than 407 pg/mL (300 pmol/L) [ 44 ].\nConditions associated with vitamin B12 inadequacy include pernicious anemia, present in about 15% to 25% of older adults with vitamin B12 deficiency [ 45 ]. Atrophic gastritis, an autoimmune condition affecting 2% of the general population but 8%–9% of adults age 65 and older, decreases production of intrinsic factor and secretion of hydrochloric acid in the stomach and thus decreases absorption of vitamin B12 [ 45 , 46 ]. A third condition associated with vitamin B12 deficiency in older adults is Helicobacter pylori infection, possibly because this bacterium causes inflammation that leads to malabsorption of vitamin B12 from food [ 47 ].\n",
    "Individuals with pernicious anemia": "Pernicious anemia is an irreversible autoimmune disease that affects the gastric mucosa and results in gastric atrophy [ 1 , 48 ]. This disease leads to attacks on parietal cells in the stomach, resulting in failure to produce intrinsic factor and malabsorption of dietary vitamin B12, recycled biliary vitamin B12, and free vitamin B12 [ 1 , 6 , 11 ].Therefore, without treatment, pernicious anemia causes vitamin B12 deficiency, even in the presence of adequate vitamin B12 intakes.\nPernicious anemia is the most common cause of clinically evident vitamin B12 deficiency around the world [ 11 , 48 ]. The incidence of pernicious anemia in the United States is an estimated 151 per 100,000, and this condition is more common in women and in people of European ancestry [ 48 ].\n",
    "Individuals who have had gastrointestinal surgery": "Surgical procedures in the gastrointestinal tract, such as for weight loss or to remove all or part of the stomach, can cause a complete or partial loss of cells that secrete hydrochloric acid and cells that secrete intrinsic factor [ 54 , 55 ]. Thus, these procedures reduce the amount of vitamin B12, particularly food-bound vitamin B12, that the body absorbs [ 54 , 55 ]. High doses (1,000 mcg/day) of oral methylcobalamin supplements appear to be as effective as hydroxycobalamin injections in normalizing vitamin B12 values in patients who have undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery [ 55 ].\n",
    "Vegetarians": "Vegans who consume no animal products and vegetarians who consume some animal products (e.g., dairy products, eggs, or both) but not meat have a higher risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency because natural food sources of vitamin B12 are limited to animal foods [ 3 , 57 ]. Consumption of foods fortified with vitamin B12 (such as fortified nutritional yeasts) as well as vitamin B12 supplements can substantially reduce the risk of deficiency [ 57 ].\n",
    "Infants of vegan women": "Exclusively breastfed infants of women who consume no animal products might have very limited reserves of vitamin B12 and can develop vitamin B12 deficiency, sometimes very early in life [ 58 ]. The infant’s deficiency can be severe, especially if the mother’s deficiency is severe or caused by pernicious anemia; sometimes, the mother’s own deficiency is clinically mild and not recognized. Undetected and untreated vitamin B12 deficiency in infants can result in neurological damage, failure to thrive, developmental delays, and anemia [ 2 , 58 , 59 ]. The reasons include the small amounts of vitamin B12 in the breast milk of vegan mothers as well as the limited amounts of vitamin B12 crossing the placenta in these women during fetal development.\n",
    "Vitamin B12 and Health": "This section focuses on areas of health in which vitamin B12 might be involved: cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke, dementia and cognitive function, and energy and endurance.\n",
    "Cardiovascular disease and stroke": "An elevated homocysteine level has been associated with an increased risk of CVD [ 74 , 75 ]. Vitamin B12 and other B vitamins are involved in homocysteine metabolism, and researchers have hypothesized that supplementation with these micronutrients can reduce CVD risk by lowering homocysteine levels [ 74 , 75 ].\nHowever, studies on the association between vitamin B12 intake and risk of CVD have had negative results. Two meta-analyses—one of 11 prospective cohort studies in 369,746 individuals who developed 5,133 cases of coronary heart disease and one of 12 prospective (mostly cohort) studies in 389,938 participants who developed 10,749 cases of stroke over 4.2 to 19 years (including 10 reports that evaluated the association between dietary vitamin B12 intake and stroke risk)—found no significant association between vitamin B12 intakes and risk of coronary heart disease [ 76 ] or stroke [ 77 ].\nRCTs have found that vitamin B12 (and folic acid) supplements lower homocysteine levels but not CVD risk. The authors of a Cochrane Review of the effects of homocysteine-lowering interventions on cardiovascular events based on 15 studies in 71,422 participants concluded that supplements of vitamin B12 alone or with other B vitamins do not prevent heart attacks or reduce death rates in people at risk of or with CVD [ 78 ]. More recently, an extended follow-up of the B-PROOF trial, (which compared 400 mcg folic acid and 500 mcg vitamin B-12 daily with placebo) in 1,298 participants found that after a median of 54 months, the intervention had no effect on CVD risk [ 79 ].\nOverall, the available evidence suggests that supplementation with vitamin B12 alone or in combination with other B-vitamins does not reduce the risk of CVD or of CVD-related death.\n",
    "Dementia and cognitive function": "Observational studies have shown positive associations between elevated homocysteine levels and the incidence of both Alzheimer’s disease and dementia [ 80-83 ]. Scientists hypothesize that elevated homocysteine levels might have a negative effect on the brain via numerous mechanisms, including cerebrovascular ischemia leading to neuronal cell death, activation of tau kinases leading to tangle deposition, and inhibition of methylation reactions [ 82 ].\nMost observational studies have found correlations between low serum vitamin B12 concentrations alone or in combination with high folate concentrations and poor cognitive function [ 84-89 ]. For example, an analysis of cross-sectional 2011–2014 NHANES data on 2,420 adults age 60 years or older found that low vitamin B12 (MMA greater than 0.27 micromol/L or serum vitamin B12 less than 203 pg/mL [150 pmol/L]) combined with high folic acid—unmetabolized serum folic acid greater than 0.44 mcg/L (1 nmol/L) or serum total folate higher than 32.7 mcg/L (74.1 nmol/L)—was associated with an almost two to three times higher risk of cognitive impairment [ 84 ].\nHowever, a few observational studies have found no such association [ 90 , 91 ]. In addition, according to a systematic review of 35 prospective cohort studies in 14,325 participants age 47 to 101 years followed for an average of 5.4 years, the evidence does not support a role for low vitamin B12 in the development of cognitive impairment or dementia [ 92 ].\nIn general, evidence from RCTs does not show that vitamin B12 supplementation alone or with folic acid, vitamin B6, or both for 1 to 2 years improves cognitive function in older adults with or without dementia, mild cognitive impairment, or Alzheimer’s disease, even though supplementation lowers homocysteine levels [ 93-96 ]. For example, an RCT administered 400 mcg/day folic acid and 500 mcg/day vitamin B12 (B-vitamin group) or a placebo for 2 years to 2,919 adults age 65 and older with homocysteine levels of 12 to 50 mcmol/L [ 95 ]. Although homocysteine concentrations declined significantly more (by 5.0 mcmol/L) in the supplementation group than in the placebo group (1.3 mcmol/L), cognitive test scores did not differ between groups. A Cochrane Review of vitamin and mineral supplements to maintain cognitive function in cognitively healthy people included 14 studies that compared folic acid, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, or a combination of these supplements to placebo in 27,882 participants, most of whom were age 60 years or older [ 97 ]. The supplements had little to no effect on global cognitive function when administered for up to 5 years and appeared to have no impact when administered for 5 to 10 years.\nSimilarly, supplementation with vitamin B12 alone or with other B vitamins does not appear to decrease the risk or slow the progression of dementia or Alzheimer’s disease in older adults. A Cochrane Review evaluated the effects of vitamin and mineral supplements on cognitive function and dementia in people with mild cognitive impairment [ 98 ]. The review included five trials with 879 participants that investigated B vitamin supplements (one study of folic acid only and four trials of vitamins B6 and B12 and folic acid). Taking these B vitamins for 6 to 24 months had no apparent effect on episodic memory, executive function, speed of processing, or quality of life, although one study found a slower rate of brain atrophy over 2 years.\nAdditional clinical trials are needed to better understand the effects of vitamin B12 supplementation on cognitive function and cognitive decline.\n",
    "Energy and endurance": "Because of its role in energy metabolism, vitamin B12 is often promoted as an energy enhancer and an athletic performance and endurance booster. However, vitamin B12 supplementation appears to have no beneficial effect on performance in the absence of a nutritional deficit [ 99 , 100 ].\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Vitamin B12": "The FNB did not establish a UL for vitamin B12 because of its low potential for toxicity [ 1 ]. Even at large doses, vitamin B12 is generally considered to be safe because the body does not store excess amounts.\n",
    "Gastric acid inhibitors": "Gastric acid inhibitors include proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole (Prilosec) and lansoprazole (Prevacid), and histamine 2-receptor antagonists, such as cimetidine (Tagamet) and ranitidine (Zantac). These drugs are used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease and peptic ulcer disease. They can interfere with vitamin B12 absorption from food by slowing the release of gastric acid into the stomach and thereby lead to vitamin B12 deficiency [ 101-103 ].\n",
    "Metformin": "Metformin, an antihyperglycemic agent used as first-line treatment for prediabetes and diabetes, might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 and significantly reduce serum vitamin B12 concentrations [ 103 ].\n",
    "Vitamin B12 and Healthful Diets": "The federal government’s 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Milk and milk products are good sources of vitamin B12. Many ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are fortified with vitamin B12. Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. Fish and red meat are excellent sources of vitamin B12. Poultry and eggs also contain vitamin B12. Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Limits alcoholic beverages.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet .\n",
    "Introduction": "Vitamin B6 is a water-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in many foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. It is the generic name for six compounds (vitamers) with vitamin B6 activity: pyridoxine, an alcohol; pyridoxal, an aldehyde; and pyridoxamine, which contains an amino group; and their respective 5'-phosphate esters. Pyridoxal 5' phosphate (PLP) and pyridoxamine 5' phosphate (PMP) are the active coenzyme forms of vitamin B6 [ 1 , 2 ]. Substantial proportions of the naturally occurring pyridoxine in fruits, vegetables, and grains exist in glycosylated forms that exhibit reduced bioavailability [ 3 ].\nVitamin B6 in coenzyme forms performs a wide variety of functions in the body and is extremely versatile, with involvement in more than 100 enzyme reactions, mostly concerned with protein metabolism [ 1 ]. Both PLP and PMP are involved in amino acid metabolism, and PLP is also involved in the metabolism of one-carbon units, carbohydrates, and lipids [ 3 ]. Vitamin B6 also plays a role in cognitive development through the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters and in maintaining normal levels of homocysteine, an amino acid in the blood [ 3 ]. Vitamin B6 is involved in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, immune function (for example, it promotes lymphocyte and interleukin-2 production), and hemoglobin formation [ 3 ].\nThe human body absorbs vitamin B6 in the jejunum. Phosphorylated forms of the vitamin are dephosphorylated, and the pool of free vitamin B6 is absorbed by passive diffusion [ 2 ].\nVitamin B6 concentrations can be measured directly by assessing concentrations of PLP; other vitamers; or total vitamin B6 in plasma, erythrocytes, or urine [ 1 ]. Vitamin B6 concentrations can also be measured indirectly by assessing either erythrocyte aminotransferase saturation by PLP or tryptophan metabolites. Plasma PLP is the most common measure of vitamin B6 status.\nPLP concentrations of more than 30 nmol/L have been traditional indicators of adequate vitamin B6 status in adults [ 3 ]. However, the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies (formerly National Academy of Sciences) used a plasma PLP level of 20 nmol/L as the major indicator of adequacy to calculate the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for adults [ 1 , 3 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for vitamin B6 and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the FNB [ 1 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and gender, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects.\nTable 1 lists the current RDAs for vitamin B6 [ 1 ]. For infants from birth to 12 months, the FNB established an AI for vitamin B6 that is equivalent to the mean intake of vitamin B6 in healthy, breastfed infants.\n* Adequate Intake (AI)\n",
    "Food": "Vitamin B6 is found in a wide variety of foods [ 1 , 3 , 4 ]. The richest sources of vitamin B6 include fish, beef liver and other organ meats, potatoes and other starchy vegetables, and fruit (other than citrus). In the United States, adults obtain most of their dietary vitamin B6 from fortified cereals, beef, poultry, starchy vegetables, and some noncitrus fruits [ 1 , 3 , 5 ]. About 75% of vitamin B6 from a mixed diet is bioavailable [ 1 ].\nThe table of selected food sources of vitamin B6 suggests many dietary sources of vitamin B6.\n*DV = Daily Value. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for vitamin B6 is 1.7 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 6 ]. FDA does not require food labels to list vitamin B6 content unless vitamin B6 has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) FoodData Central lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing vitamin B6 arranged by nutrient content and by food name .\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "Vitamin B6 is available in multivitamins, in supplements containing other B complex vitamins, and as a stand-alone supplement [ 7 ]. The most common vitamin B6 vitamer in supplements is pyridoxine (in the form of pyridoxine hydrochloride [HCl]), although some supplements contain PLP. Vitamin B6 supplements are available in oral capsules or tablets (including sublingual and chewable tablets) and liquids. Absorption of vitamin B6 from supplements is similar to that from food sources and does not differ substantially among the various forms of supplements [ 1 ]. Although the body absorbs large pharmacological doses of vitamin B6 well, it quickly eliminates most of the vitamin in the urine [ 8 ].\nAbout 28%–36% of the general population uses supplements containing vitamin B6 [ 9 , 10 ]. Adults age 51 years or older and children younger than 9 are more likely than members of other age groups to take supplements containing vitamin B6.\n",

For example, an analysis of data from two large randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in Norway found no association between vitamin B6 supplementation and cancer incidence, mortality, or all-cause mortality [ 18 ].\n",

    "Vitamin B6 Intakes and Status": "Most children, adolescents, and adults in the United States consume the recommended amounts of vitamin B6, according to an analysis of data from the 2003–2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) [ 10 ]. The average vitamin B6 intake is about 1.5 mg/day in women and 2 mg/day in men [ 1 ].\nHowever, 11% of vitamin B6 supplement users and 24% of people in the United States who do not take supplements containing vitamin B6 have low plasma PLP concentrations (less than 20 nmol/L) [ 10 ]. In the 2003–2004 NHANES analysis, plasma PLP concentrations were low even in some groups that took 2.0–2.9 mg/day, which is higher than the current RDA. Among supplement users and nonusers, plasma PLP levels were much lower in women than men, non-Hispanic blacks than non-Hispanic whites, current smokers than never smokers, and people who were underweight than those of normal weight. Teenagers had the lowest vitamin B6 concentrations, followed by adults age 21–44 years. However, plasma PLP levels in the elderly were not particularly low, even in those who did not use supplements. Based on these data, the authors of this analysis concluded that the current RDAs might not guarantee adequate vitamin B6 status in many population groups [ 10 ].\nPLP concentrations tend to be low in people with alcohol dependence; those with obesity; and pregnant women, especially those with preeclampsia or eclampsia [ 1 ]. They are also low in people with malabsorption syndromes such as celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis [ 3 ].\n",
    "Vitamin B6 Deficiency": "Isolated vitamin B6 deficiency is uncommon; inadequate vitamin B6 status is usually associated with low concentrations of other B-complex vitamins, such as vitamin B12 and folic acid [ 2 ]. Vitamin B6 deficiency causes biochemical changes that become more obvious as the deficiency progresses [ 2 ].\nVitamin B6 deficiency is associated with microcytic anemia, electroencephalographic abnormalities, dermatitis with cheilosis (scaling on the lips and cracks at the corners of the mouth) and glossitis (swollen tongue), depression and confusion, and weakened immune function [ 1 , 2 ]. Individuals with borderline vitamin B6 concentrations or mild deficiency might have no deficiency signs or symptoms for months or even years. In infants, vitamin B6 deficiency causes irritability, abnormally acute hearing, and convulsive seizures [ 2 ].\nEnd-stage renal diseases, chronic renal insufficiency, and other kidney diseases can cause vitamin B6 deficiency [ 3 ]. In addition, vitamin B6 deficiency can result from malabsorption syndromes, such as celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Certain genetic diseases, such as homocystinuria, can also cause vitamin B6 deficiency [ 2 ]. Some medications, such as antiepileptic drugs, can lead to deficiency over time.\n",
    "Groups at Risk of Vitamin B6 Inadequacy": "Frank vitamin B6 deficiencies are relatively rare in the United States but some individuals might have marginal vitamin B6 status [ 2 ]. The following groups are among those most likely to have inadequate intakes of vitamin B6.\n",
    "Individuals with impaired renal function": "People with poor renal function, including those with end-stage renal disease and chronic renal insufficiency, often have low vitamin B6 concentrations [ 3 ]. Plasma PLP concentrations are also low in patients receiving maintenance kidney dialysis or intermittent peritoneal dialysis, as well as those who have undergone a kidney transplant, perhaps due to increased metabolic clearance of PLP [ 11 ]. Patients with kidney disease often show clinical symptoms similar to those of people with vitamin B6 deficiency [ 11 ].\n",
    "Individuals with autoimmune disorders": "People with rheumatoid arthritis often have low vitamin B6 concentrations, and vitamin B6 concentrations tend to decrease with increased disease severity [ 3 ]. These low vitamin B6 levels are due to the inflammation caused by the disease and, in turn, increase the inflammation associated with the disease. Although vitamin B6 supplements can normalize vitamin B6 concentrations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, they do not suppress the production of inflammatory cytokines or decrease levels of inflammatory markers [ 3 , 12 ].\nPatients with celiac disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and other malabsorptive autoimmune disorders tend to have low plasma PLP concentrations [ 3 ]. The mechanisms for this effect are not known. However, celiac disease is associated with lower pyridoxine absorption, and low PLP concentrations in inflammatory bowel disease could be due to the inflammatory response [ 3 ].\n",
    "People with alcohol dependence": "Plasma PLP concentrations tend to be very low in people with alcohol dependence [ 1 ]. Alcohol produces acetaldehyde, which decreases net PLP formation by cells and competes with PLP in protein binding [ 1 , 3 ]. As a result, the PLP in cells might be more susceptible to hydrolysis by membrane-bound phosphatase. People with alcohol dependence might benefit from pyridoxine supplementation [ 3 ].\n",
    "Cardiovascular disease": "Scientists have hypothesized that certain B vitamins (folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6) might reduce cardiovascular disease risk by lowering homocysteine levels [ 1 , 13 ]. Therefore, several clinical trials have assessed the safety and efficacy of supplemental doses of B vitamins to reduce heart disease risk. Evaluating the impact of vitamin B6 from many of these trials is challenging because these studies also included folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation. For example, the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation 2 (HOPE 2) trial, which included more than 5,500 adults with known cardiovascular disease, found that supplementation for 5 years with vitamin B6 (50 mg/day), vitamin B12 (1 mg/day), and folic acid (2.5 mg/day) reduced homocysteine levels and decreased stroke risk by about 25%, but the study did not include a separate vitamin B6 group [ 14 ].\nMoreover, most other large clinical trials have failed to demonstrate that supplemental B vitamins actually reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, even though they lower homocysteine levels. For example, a randomized clinical trial in 5,442 women age 42 or older found no effect of vitamin B6 supplementation (50 mg/day) in combination with 2.5 mg folic acid and 1 mg vitamin B12 on cardiovascular disease risk [ 15 ]. Two large randomized controlled trials, the Norwegian Vitamin Trial and the Western Norway B Vitamin Intervention Trial, did include a group that received only vitamin B6 supplements (40 mg/day). The combined analysis of data from these two trials showed no benefit of vitamin B6 supplementation, with or without folic acid (0.8 mg/day) plus vitamin B12 (0.4 mg/day), on major cardiovascular events in 6,837 patients with ischemic heart disease [ 13 ]. In a trial of adults who had suffered a nondisabling stroke, supplementation with high or low doses of a combination of vitamins B6 and B12 and folic acid for 2 years had no effect on subsequent stroke incidence, cardiovascular events, or risk of death [ 16 ].\nThe research to date provides little evidence that supplemental amounts of vitamin B6, alone or with folic acid and vitamin B12, can help reduce the risk or severity of cardiovascular disease and stroke.\n",
    "Cognitive function": "Poor vitamin B6 status has been hypothesized to play a role in the cognitive decline that some older adults experience [ 19 ]. Several studies have demonstrated an association between vitamin B6 and brain function in the elderly. For example, an analysis of data from the Boston Normative Aging Study found associations between higher serum vitamin B6 concentrations and better memory test scores in 70 men age 54–81 years [ 20 ].\nHowever, a systematic review of 14 randomized controlled trials found insufficient evidence of an effect of vitamin B6 supplementation alone or in combination with vitamin B12 and/or folic acid on cognitive function in people with normal cognitive function, dementia, or ischemic vascular disease [ 19 ]. According to this review, most of the studies were of low quality and limited applicability. A Cochrane Review found no evidence that short-term vitamin B6 supplementation (for 5–12 weeks) improves cognitive function or mood in the two studies that the authors evaluated [ 21 ]. The review did find some evidence that daily vitamin B6 supplements (20 mg) can affect biochemical indices of vitamin B6 status in healthy older men, but these changes had no overall impact on cognition.\nMore evidence is needed to determine whether vitamin B6 supplements might help prevent or treat cognitive decline in elderly people.\n",
    "Premenstrual syndrome": "Some evidence suggests that vitamin B6 supplements could reduce the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), but conclusions are limited due to the poor quality of most studies [ 22 ]. A meta-analysis of nine published trials involving almost 1,000 women with PMS found that vitamin B6 is more effective in reducing PMS symptoms than placebo, but most of the studies analyzed were small and several had methodological weaknesses [ 22 ]. A more recent double-blind, randomized controlled trial in 94 women found that 80 mg pyridoxine taken daily over the course of three cycles was associated with statistically significant reductions in a broad range of PMS symptoms, including moodiness; irritability; forgetfulness; bloating; and, especially, anxiety [ 23 ]. The potential effectiveness of vitamin B6 in alleviating the mood-related symptoms of PMS could be due to its role as a cofactor in neurotransmitter biosynthesis [ 24 ]. Although vitamin B6 shows promise for alleviating PMS symptoms, more research is needed before drawing firm conclusions.\n",
    "Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy": "About half of all women experience nausea and vomiting in the first few months of pregnancy, and about 50%–80% experience nausea only [ 25 , 26 ]. Although this condition is generally known as morning sickness, it often lasts throughout the day. The condition is not life threatening and typically goes away after 12–20 weeks, but its symptoms can disrupt a person's social and physical functioning.\nProspective studies on vitamin B6 supplements to treat morning sickness have had mixed results. In two randomized, placebo-controlled trials, 30–75 mg of oral pyridoxine per day significantly decreased nausea in pregnant women who were experiencing nausea [ 27 , 28 ]. The authors of a recent Cochrane Review of studies on interventions for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy could not draw firm conclusions on the value of vitamin B6 to control the symptoms of morning sickness [ 26 ].\nRandomized trials have shown that a combination of vitamin B6 and doxylamine (an antihistamine) is associated with a 70% reduction in nausea and vomiting in pregnant women and lower hospitalization rates for this problem [ 25 , 29 ].\nThe American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) recommends monotherapy with 10–25 mg of vitamin B6 three or four times a day to treat nausea and vomiting in pregnancy [ 29 ]. If the patient's condition does not improve, ACOG recommends adding doxylamine. Before taking a vitamin B6 supplement, pregnant women should consult a physician because doses could approach the UL.\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Vitamin B6": "High intakes of vitamin B6 from food sources have not been reported to cause adverse effects [ 1 ]. However, chronic administration of 1–6 g oral pyridoxine per day for 12–40 months can cause severe and progressive sensory neuropathy characterized by ataxia (loss of control of bodily movements) [ 10 , 30-33 ]. Symptom severity appears to be dose dependent, and the symptoms usually stop if the patient discontinues the pyridoxine supplements as soon as the neurologic symptoms appear. Other effects of excessive vitamin B6 intakes include painful, disfiguring dermatological lesions; photosensitivity; and gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea and heartburn [ 1 , 2 , 30 ].\nThe scientific literature includes isolated case reports of congenital defects in the infants of women who took pyridoxine supplements during the first half of pregnancy [ 7 ]. However, a more recent observational study found no association between pyridoxine supplementation (mean dose 132.3 ± 74 mg/day) in pregnant women starting at 7 weeks gestation and continuing for 9 ± 4.2 weeks and teratogenic effects in their infants [ 34 ].\nThe FNB has established ULs for vitamin B6 that apply to both food and supplement intakes (Table 3) [ 1 ]. The FNB noted that although several reports show sensory neuropathy occurring at doses lower than 500 mg/day, studies in patients treated with vitamin B6 (average dose of 200 mg/day) for up to 5 years found no evidence of this effect. Based on limitations in the data on potential harms from long-term use, the FNB halved the dose used in these studies to establish a UL of 100 mg/day for adults. ULs are lower for children and adolescents based on body size. The ULs do not apply to individuals receiving vitamin B6 for medical treatment, but such individuals should be under the care of a physician.\n*Breast milk, formula, and food should be the only sources of vitamin B6 for infants.\nIn 2023, the Panel on Nutrition, Novel Foods and Food Allergens of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) released a scientific opinion on the tolerable upper intake levels for vitamin B6 [ 35 ]. Based on systematic reviews that examined associations between vitamin B6 and peripheral neuropathy, the panel set an upper limit for vitamin B6 of 12 mg/day for all adults, including women who are pregnant or lactating, with lower amounts ranging from 2.2 to 10.7 mg/day for infants and children, depending on age.\n",
    "Cycloserine": "Cycloserine (Seromycin) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis. In combination with pyridoxal phosphate, cycloserine increases urinary excretion of pyridoxine [ 9 ]. The urinary loss of pyridoxine might exacerbate the seizures and neurotoxicity associated with cycloserine. Pyridoxine supplements can help prevent these adverse effects.\n",
    "Antiepileptic medications": "Some antiepileptic drugs, including valproic acid (Depakene, Stavzor), carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Epitol, Tegretol, and others), and phenytoin (Dilantin) increase the catabolism rate of vitamin B6 vitamers, resulting in low plasma PLP concentrations and hyperhomocysteinemia [ 36 , 37 ]. High homocysteine levels in antiepileptic drug users might increase the risk of epileptic seizures and systemic vascular events, including stroke, and reduce the ability to control seizures in patients with epilepsy. Furthermore, patients typically use antiepileptic drugs for years, increasing their risk of chronic vascular toxicity.\nSome research also indicates that pyridoxine supplementation (200 mg/day for 12–120 days) can reduce serum concentrations of phenytoin and phenobarbital, possibly by increasing the drugs' metabolism [ 33 , 38 ]. Whether lower pyridoxine doses have any effect is not known [ 9 ].\nLevetiracetam (Keppra) is an antiepileptic medication with behavioral side effects that include irritability, agitation, and depression [ 39-41 ]. Preliminary evidence suggests that vitamin B6 supplementation—at such doses as 50–350 mg/day in children [ 40-42 ] and 50–100 mg/day in adults [ 39 ]—might reduce these side effects.\n",
    "Theophylline": "Theophylline (Aquaphyllin, Elixophyllin, Theolair, Truxophyllin, and many others) can prevent or treat shortness of breath, wheezing, and other breathing problems caused by asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and other lung diseases. Patients treated with theophylline often have low plasma PLP concentrations, which could contribute to the neurological and central nervous system side effects associated with theophylline, including seizures [ 9 , 33 ].\n",
    "Vitamin B6 and Healthful Diets": "The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Many fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are good sources of vitamin B6. Some ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are fortified with vitamin B6. Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. Fish, beef, and turkey contain high amounts of vitamin B6. Beans and nuts are also sources of vitamin B6. Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Limits alcoholic beverages. Stays within your daily calorie needs.\nMany fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are good sources of vitamin B6.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet .\nFor information on vitamin C and COVID-19, see Dietary Supplements in the Time of COVID-19 .\n",
    "Introduction": "Vitamin C, also known as L-ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in some foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. Humans, unlike most animals, are unable to synthesize vitamin C endogenously, so it is an essential dietary component [ 1 ].\nVitamin C is required for the biosynthesis of collagen, L-carnitine, and certain neurotransmitters; vitamin C is also involved in protein metabolism [ 1 , 2 ]. Collagen is an essential component of connective tissue, which plays a vital role in wound healing. Vitamin C is also an important physiological antioxidant [ 3 ] and has been shown to regenerate other antioxidants within the body, including alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) [ 4 ]. Ongoing research is examining whether vitamin C, by limiting the damaging effects of free radicals through its antioxidant activity, might help prevent or delay the development of certain cancers, cardiovascular disease, and other diseases in which oxidative stress plays a causal role. In addition to its biosynthetic and antioxidant functions, vitamin C plays an important role in immune function [ 4 ] and improves the absorption of nonheme iron [ 5 ], the form of iron present in plant-based foods. Insufficient vitamin C intake causes scurvy, which is characterized by fatigue or lassitude, widespread connective tissue weakness, and capillary fragility [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 6-9 ].\nThe intestinal absorption of vitamin C is regulated by at least one specific dose-dependent, active transporter [ 4 ]. Cells accumulate vitamin C via a second specific transport protein. In vitro studies have found that oxidized vitamin C, or dehydroascorbic acid, enters cells via some facilitated glucose transporters and is then reduced internally to ascorbic acid. The physiologic importance of dehydroascorbic acid uptake and its contribution to overall vitamin C economy are unknown.\nOral vitamin C produces tissue and plasma concentrations that the body tightly controls. Approximately 70%–90% of vitamin C is absorbed at moderate intakes of 30–180 mg/day. However, at doses above 1 g/day, absorption falls to less than 50% and absorbed, unmetabolized ascorbic acid is excreted in the urine [ 4 ]. Results from pharmacokinetic studies indicate that oral doses of 1.25 g/day ascorbic acid produce mean peak plasma vitamin C concentrations of 135 micromol/L, which are about two times higher than those produced by consuming 200–300 mg/day ascorbic acid from vitamin C-rich foods [ 10 ]. Pharmacokinetic modeling predicts that even doses as high as 3 g ascorbic acid taken every 4 hours would produce peak plasma concentrations of only 220 micromol/L [ 10 ].\nThe total body content of vitamin C ranges from 300 mg (at near scurvy) to about 2 g [ 4 ]. High levels of vitamin C (millimolar concentrations) are maintained in cells and tissues and are highest in leukocytes (white blood cells), eyes, adrenal glands, pituitary gland, and brain. Relatively low levels of vitamin C (micromolar concentrations) are found in extracellular fluids, such as plasma, red blood cells, and saliva [ 4 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for vitamin C and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academies (formerly National Academy of Sciences) [ 8 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and gender [ 8 ], include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nTable 1 lists the current RDAs for vitamin C [ 8 ]. The RDAs for vitamin C are based on its known physiological and antioxidant functions in white blood cells and are much higher than the amount required for protection from deficiency [ 4 , 8 , 11 ]. For infants from birth to 12 months, the FNB established an AI for vitamin C that is equivalent to the mean intake of vitamin C in healthy, breastfed infants.\n* Adequate Intake (AI)\n",
    "Food": "Fruits and vegetables are the best sources of vitamin C (see Table 2) [ 12 ]. Citrus fruits, tomatoes and tomato juice, and potatoes are major contributors of vitamin C to the American diet [ 8 ]. Other good food sources include red and green peppers, kiwifruit, broccoli, strawberries, Brussels sprouts, and cantaloupe (see Table 2) [ 8 , 12 ]. Although vitamin C is not naturally present in grains, it is added to some fortified breakfast cereals. The vitamin C content of food may be reduced by prolonged storage and by cooking because ascorbic acid is water soluble and is destroyed by heat [ 6 , 8 ]. Steaming or microwaving may lessen cooking losses. Fortunately, many of the best food sources of vitamin C, such as fruits and vegetables, are usually consumed raw. Consuming five varied servings of fruits and vegetables a day can provide more than 200 mg of vitamin C.\n*DV = Daily Value. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for vitamin C is 90 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 13 ]. FDA does not require food labels to list vitamin C content unless vitamin C has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) FoodData Central lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing vitamin C arranged by nutrient content and by food name .\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "Supplements typically contain vitamin C in the form of ascorbic acid, which has equivalent bioavailability to that of naturally occurring ascorbic acid in foods, such as orange juice and broccoli [ 14-16 ]. Other forms of vitamin C supplements include sodium ascorbate; calcium ascorbate; other mineral ascorbates; ascorbic acid with bioflavonoids; and combination products, such as Ester-C, which contains calcium ascorbate, dehydroascorbate, calcium threonate, xylonate and lyxonate [ 17 ].\nA few studies in humans have examined whether bioavailability differs among the various forms of vitamin C. In one study, Ester-C and ascorbic acid produced the same vitamin C plasma concentrations, but Ester-C produced significantly higher vitamin C concentrations in leukocytes 24 hours after ingestion [ 18 ]. Another study found no differences in plasma vitamin C levels or urinary excretion of vitamin C among three different vitamin C sources: ascorbic acid, Ester-C, and ascorbic acid with bioflavonoids [ 17 ]. These findings, coupled with the relatively low cost of ascorbic acid, led the authors to conclude that simple ascorbic acid is the preferred source of supplemental vitamin C [ 17 ].\n",

    "Cardiovascular disease": "Evidence from many epidemiological studies suggests that high intakes of fruits and vegetables are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease [ 1 , 55 , 56 ]. This association might be partly attributable to the antioxidant content of these foods because oxidative damage, including oxidative modification of low-density lipoproteins, is a major cause of cardiovascular disease [ 1 , 4 , 56 ]. In addition to its antioxidant properties, vitamin C has been shown to reduce monocyte adherence to the endothelium, improve endothelium-dependent nitric oxide production and vasodilation, and reduce vascular smooth-muscle-cell apoptosis, which prevents plaque instability in atherosclerosis [ 2 , 57 ].\nResults from prospective studies examining associations between vitamin C intake and cardiovascular disease risk are conflicting [ 56 ]. In the Nurses' Health Study, a 16-year prospective study involving 85,118 female nurses, total intake of vitamin C from both dietary and supplemental sources was inversely associated with coronary heart disease risk [ 58 ]. However, intake of vitamin C from diet alone showed no significant associations, suggesting that vitamin C supplement users might be at lower risk of coronary heart disease. A much smaller study indicated that postmenopausal women with diabetes who took at least 300 mg/day vitamin C supplements had increased cardiovascular disease mortality [ 59 ].\nA prospective study in 20,649 British adults found that those in the top quartile of baseline plasma vitamin C concentrations had a 42% lower risk of stroke than those in the bottom quartile [ 60 ]. In male physicians participating in the Physicians' Health Study, use of vitamin C supplements for a mean of 5.5 years was not associated with a significant decrease in total cardiovascular disease mortality or coronary heart disease mortality [ 61 ]. A pooled analysis of nine prospective studies that included 293,172 subjects free of coronary heart disease at baseline found that people who took ≥700 mg/day of supplemental vitamin C had a 25% lower risk of coronary heart disease incidence than those who took no supplemental vitamin C [ 62 ]. The authors of a 2008 meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies, including 14 studies reporting on vitamin C for a median follow-up of 10 years, concluded that dietary, but not supplemental, intake of vitamin C is inversely associated with coronary heart disease risk [ 55 ].\nResults from most clinical intervention trials have failed to show a beneficial effect of vitamin C supplementation on the primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. In the Women's Antioxidant Cardiovascular Study, a secondary prevention trial involving 8,171 women age 40 years or older with a history of cardiovascular disease, supplementation with 500 mg/day vitamin C for a mean of 9.4 years showed no overall effect on cardiovascular events [ 63 ]. Similarly, vitamin C supplementation (500 mg/day) for a mean follow-up of 8 years had no effect on major cardiovascular events in male physicians enrolled in the Physicians' Health Study II [ 64 ].\nOther clinical trials have generally examined the effects on cardiovascular disease of supplements combining vitamin C with other antioxidants, such as vitamin E and beta-carotene, making it more difficult to isolate the potential contribution of vitamin C. The SU.VI.MAX study examined the effects of a combination of vitamin C (120 mg/day), vitamin E (30 mg/day), beta-carotene (6 mg/day), selenium (100 mcg/day), and zinc (20 mg/day) in 13,017 French adults from the general population [ 33 ]. After a median follow-up time of 7.5 years, the combined supplements had no effect on ischemic cardiovascular disease in either men or women. In the Women's Angiographic Vitamin and Estrogen study, involving 423 postmenopausal women with at least one coronary stenosis of 15%–75%, supplements of 500 mg vitamin C plus 400 IU vitamin E twice per day not only provided no cardiovascular benefit, but significantly increased all-cause mortality compared with placebo [ 65 ].\nThe authors of a 2006 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that antioxidant supplements (vitamins C and E and beta-carotene or selenium) do not affect the progression of atherosclerosis [ 66 ]. Similarly, a systematic review of vitamin C's effects on the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease found that vitamin C did not have favorable effects on cardiovascular disease prevention [ 67 ]. Since then, researchers have published follow-up data from the Linxian trial, a population nutrition intervention trial conducted in China [ 38 ]. In this trial, daily vitamin C supplements (120 mg) plus molybdenum (30 mcg) for 5–6 years significantly reduced the risk of cerebrovascular deaths by 8% during 10 years of follow-up after the end of the active intervention.\nAlthough the Linxian trial data suggest a possible benefit, overall, the findings from most intervention trials do not provide convincing evidence that vitamin C supplements provide protection against cardiovascular disease or reduce its morbidity or mortality. However, as discussed in the cancer prevention section, clinical trial data for vitamin C are limited by the fact that plasma and tissue concentrations of vitamin C are tightly controlled in humans. If subjects' vitamin C levels were already close to saturation at study entry, supplementation would be expected to have made little or no difference on measured outcomes [ 22 , 23 , 41 , 42 ].\n",

    "Vitamin C Intakes and Status": "According to the 2001–2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), mean intakes of vitamin C are 105.2 mg/day for adult males and 83.6 mg/day for adult females, meeting the currently established RDA for most nonsmoking adults [ 19 ]. Mean intakes for children and adolescents age 1–18 years range from 75.6 mg/day to 100 mg/day, also meeting the RDA for these age groups [ 19 ]. Although the 2001–2002 NHANES analysis did not include data for breastfed infants and toddlers, breastmilk is considered an adequate source of vitamin C [ 8 , 14 ]. Use of vitamin C-containing supplements is also relatively common, adding to the total vitamin C intake from food and beverages. NHANES data from 1999–2000 indicate that approximately 35% of adults take multivitamin supplements (which typically contain vitamin C) and 12% take a separate vitamin C supplement [ 20 ]. According to 1999–2002 NHANES data, approximately 29% of children take some form of dietary supplement that contains vitamin C [ 21 ].\nVitamin C status is typically assessed by measuring plasma vitamin C levels [ 4 , 14 ]. Other measures, such as leukocyte vitamin C concentration, could be more accurate indicators of tissue vitamin C levels, but they are more difficult to assess and the results are not always reliable [ 4 , 9 , 14 ].\n",
    "Vitamin C Deficiency": "Acute vitamin C deficiency leads to scurvy [ 7 , 8 , 11 ]. The timeline for the development of scurvy varies, depending on vitamin C body stores, but signs can appear within 1 month of little or no vitamin C intake (below 10 mg/day) [ 6 , 7 , 22 , 23 ]. Initial symptoms can include fatigue (probably the result of impaired carnitine biosynthesis), malaise, and inflammation of the gums [ 4 , 11 ]. As vitamin C deficiency progresses, collagen synthesis becomes impaired and connective tissues become weakened, causing petechiae, ecchymoses, purpura, joint pain, poor wound healing, hyperkeratosis, and corkscrew hairs [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 6-8 ]. Additional signs of scurvy include depression as well as swollen, bleeding gums and loosening or loss of teeth due to tissue and capillary fragility [ 6 , 8 , 9 ]. Iron deficiency anemia can also occur due to increased bleeding and decreased nonheme iron absorption secondary to low vitamin C intake [ 6 , 11 ]. In children, bone disease can be present [ 6 ]. Left untreated, scurvy is fatal [ 6 , 9 ].\nUntil the end of the 18 th century, many sailors who ventured on long ocean voyages, with little or no vitamin C intake, contracted or died from scurvy. During the mid-1700s, Sir James Lind, a British Navy surgeon, conducted experiments and determined that eating citrus fruits or juices could cure scurvy, although scientists did not prove that ascorbic acid was the active component until 1932 [ 24-26 ].\nToday, vitamin C deficiency and scurvy are rare in developed countries [ 8 ]. Overt deficiency symptoms occur only if vitamin C intake falls below approximately 10 mg/day for many weeks [ 5-8 , 22 , 23 ]. Vitamin C deficiency is uncommon in developed countries but can still occur in people with limited food variety.\n",
    "Groups at Risk of Vitamin C Inadequacy": "Vitamin C inadequacy can occur with intakes that fall below the RDA but are above the amount required to prevent overt deficiency (approximately 10 mg/day). The following groups are more likely than others to be at risk of obtaining insufficient amounts of vitamin C.\n",
    "Smokers and passive smokers": "Studies consistently show that smokers have lower plasma and leukocyte vitamin C levels than nonsmokers, due in part to increased oxidative stress [ 8 ]. For this reason, the IOM concluded that smokers need 35 mg more vitamin C per day than nonsmokers [ 8 ]. Exposure to secondhand smoke also decreases vitamin C levels. Although the IOM was unable to establish a specific vitamin C requirement for nonsmokers who are regularly exposed to secondhand smoke, these individuals should ensure that they meet the RDA for vitamin C [ 4 , 8 ].\n",
    "Infants fed evaporated or boiled milk": "Most infants in developed countries are fed breastmilk and/or infant formula, both of which supply adequate amounts of vitamin C [ 8 , 14 ]. For many reasons, feeding infants evaporated or boiled cow's milk is not recommended. This practice can cause vitamin C deficiency because cow's milk naturally has very little vitamin C and heat can destroy vitamin C [ 6 , 12 ].\n",
    "Individuals with limited food variety": "Although fruits and vegetables are the best sources of vitamin C, many other foods have small amounts of this nutrient. Thus, through a varied diet, most people should be able to meet the vitamin C RDA or at least obtain enough to prevent scurvy. People who have limited food variety—including some elderly, indigent individuals who prepare their own food; people who abuse alcohol or drugs; food faddists; people with mental illness; and, occasionally, children—might not obtain sufficient vitamin C [ 4 , 6-9 , 11 ].\n",
    "People with malabsorption and certain chronic diseases": "Some medical conditions can reduce the absorption of vitamin C and/or increase the amount needed by the body. People with severe intestinal malabsorption or cachexia and some cancer patients might be at increased risk of vitamin C inadequacy [ 27 ]. Low vitamin C concentrations can also occur in patients with end-stage renal disease on chronic hemodialysis [ 28 ].\n",
    "Vitamin C and Health": "Due to its function as an antioxidant and its role in immune function, vitamin C has been promoted as a means to help prevent and/or treat numerous health conditions. This section focuses on the following four diseases and disorders in which vitamin C might play a role: cancer (including prevention and treatment), cardiovascular disease, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts, and the common cold.\n",
    "Cancer prevention": "Epidemiologic evidence suggests that higher consumption of fruits and vegetables is associated with lower risk of most types of cancer, perhaps, in part, due to their high vitamin C content [ 1 , 2 ]. Vitamin C can limit the formation of carcinogens, such as nitrosamines [ 2 , 29 ], in vivo; modulate immune response [ 2 , 4 ]; and, through its antioxidant function, possibly attenuate oxidative damage that can lead to cancer [ 1 ].\nMost case-control studies have found an inverse association between dietary vitamin C intake and cancers of the lung, breast, colon or rectum, stomach, oral cavity, larynx or pharynx, and esophagus [ 2 , 4 ]. Plasma concentrations of vitamin C are also lower in people with cancer than controls [ 2 ].\nHowever, evidence from prospective cohort studies is inconsistent, possibly due to varying intakes of vitamin C among studies. In a cohort of 82,234 women age 33–60 years from the Nurses' Health Study, consumption of an average of 205 mg/day of vitamin C from food (highest quintile of intake) compared with an average of 70 mg/day (lowest quintile of intake) was associated with a 63% lower risk of breast cancer among premenopausal women with a family history of breast cancer [ 30 ]. Conversely, Kushi and colleagues did not observe a significantly lower risk of breast cancer among postmenopausal women consuming at least 198 mg/day (highest quintile of intake) of vitamin C from food compared with those consuming less than 87 mg/day (lowest quintile of intake) [ 31 ]. A review by Carr and Frei concluded that in the majority of prospective cohort studies not reporting a significantly lower cancer risk, most participants had relatively high vitamin C intakes, with intakes higher than 86 mg/day in the lowest quintiles [ 2 ]. Studies reporting significantly lower cancer risk found these associations in individuals with vitamin C intakes of at least 80–110 mg/day, a range associated with close to vitamin C tissue saturation [ 2 , 22 , 32 ].\nEvidence from most randomized clinical trials suggests that vitamin C supplementation, usually in combination with other micronutrients, does not affect cancer risk. In the Supplémentation en Vitamines et Minéraux Antioxydants (SU.VI.MAX) study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial,13,017 healthy French adults received antioxidant supplementation with 120 mg ascorbic acid, 30 mg vitamin E, 6 mg beta-carotene, 100 mcg selenium, and 20 mg zinc, or placebo [ 33 ]. After a median follow-up time of 7.5 years, antioxidant supplementation lowered total cancer incidence in men but not in women. In addition, baseline antioxidant status was related to cancer risk in men but not in women [ 34 ]. Supplements of 500 mg/day vitamin C plus 400 International Units (IU) vitamin E every other day for a mean follow-up period of 8 years failed to reduce the risk of prostate or total cancer compared with placebo in middle-aged and older men participating in the Physicians' Health Study II [ 35 ]. Similar findings were reported in women participating in the Women's Antioxidant Cardiovascular Study [ 36 ]. Compared with placebo, supplementation with vitamin C (500 mg/day) for an average of 9.4 years had no significant effect on total cancer incidence or cancer mortality. In a large intervention trial conducted in Linxian, China, daily supplements of vitamin C (120 mg) plus molybdenum (30 mcg) for 5–6 years did not significantly affect the risk of developing esophageal or gastric cancer [ 37 ]. Moreover, during 10 years of follow-up, this supplementation regimen failed to significantly affect total morbidity or mortality from esophageal, gastric, or other cancers [ 38 ]. A 2008 review of vitamin C and other antioxidant supplements for the prevention of gastrointestinal cancers found no convincing evidence that vitamin C (or beta-carotene, vitamin A, or vitamin E) prevents gastrointestinal cancers [ 39 ]. A similar review by Coulter and colleagues found that vitamin C supplementation, in combination with vitamin E, had no significant effect on death risk due to cancer in healthy individuals [ 40 ].\nAt this time, the evidence is inconsistent on whether dietary vitamin C intake affects cancer risk. Results from most clinical trials suggest that modest vitamin C supplementation alone or with other nutrients offers no benefit in the prevention of cancer.\nA substantial limitation in interpreting many of these studies is that investigators did not measure vitamin C concentrations before or after supplementation. Plasma and tissue concentrations of vitamin C are tightly controlled in humans. At daily intakes of 100 mg or higher, cells appear to be saturated and at intakes of at least 200 mg, plasma concentrations increase only marginally [ 2 , 10 , 22 , 31 , 37 ]. If subjects' vitamin C levels were already close to saturation at study entry, supplementation would be expected to have made little or no difference on measured outcomes [ 22 , 23 , 41 , 42 ].\n",
    "Cancer treatment": "During the 1970s, studies by Cameron, Campbell, and Pauling suggested that high-dose vitamin C has beneficial effects on quality of life and survival time in patients with terminal cancer [ 43 , 44 ]. However, some subsequent studies—including a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial by Moertel and colleagues at the Mayo Clinic [ 45 ]—did not support these findings. In the Moertel study, patients with advanced colorectal cancer who received 10 g/day vitamin C fared no better than those receiving a placebo. The authors of a 2003 review assessing the effects of vitamin C in patients with advanced cancer concluded that vitamin C confers no significant mortality benefit [ 40 ].\nEmerging research suggests that the route of vitamin C administration (intravenous [IV] vs. oral) could explain the conflicting findings [ 1 , 46 , 47 ]. Most intervention trials, including the one conducted by Moertel and colleagues, used only oral administration, whereas Cameron and colleagues used a combination of oral and IV administration. Oral administration of vitamin C, even of very large doses, can raise plasma vitamin C concentrations to a maximum of only 220 micromol/L, whereas IV administration can produce plasma concentrations as high as 26,000 micromol/L [ 47 , 48 ]. Concentrations of this magnitude are selectively cytotoxic to tumor cells in vitro [ 1 , 67 ]. Research in mice suggests that pharmacologic doses of IV vitamin C might show promise in treating otherwise difficult-to-treat tumors [ 49 ]. A high concentration of vitamin C may act as a pro-oxidant and generate hydrogen peroxide that has selective toxicity toward cancer cells [ 49-51 ]. Based on these findings and a few case reports of patients with advanced cancers who had remarkably long survival times following administration of high-dose IV vitamin C, some researchers support reassessment of the use of high-dose IV vitamin C as a drug to treat cancer [ 3 , 47 , 49 , 52 ].\nAs discussed below, it is uncertain whether supplemental vitamin C and other antioxidants might interact with chemotherapy and/or radiation [ 53 ]. Therefore, individuals undergoing these procedures should consult with their oncologist prior to taking vitamin C or other antioxidant supplements, especially in high doses [ 54 ].\n",
    "Age-related macular degeneration and cataracts": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts are two of the leading causes of vision loss in older individuals. Oxidative stress might contribute to the etiology of both conditions. Thus, researchers have hypothesized that vitamin C and other antioxidants play a role in the development and/or treatment of these diseases.\nA population-based cohort study in the Netherlands found that adults age 55 years or older who had high dietary intakes of vitamin C as well as beta-carotene, zinc, and vitamin E had a reduced risk of AMD [ 68 ]. However, most prospective studies do not support these findings [ 69 ]. The authors of a 2007 systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies and randomized clinical trials concluded that the current evidence does not support a role for vitamin C and other antioxidants, including antioxidant supplements, in the primary prevention of early AMD [ 70 ].\nAlthough research has not shown that antioxidants play a role in AMD development, some evidence suggests that they might help slow AMD progression [ 71 ]. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, evaluated the effect of high doses of selected antioxidants (500 mg vitamin C, 400 IU vitamin E, 15 mg beta-carotene, 80 mg zinc, and 2 mg copper) on the development of advanced AMD in 3,597 older individuals with varying degrees of AMD [ 72 ]. After an average follow-up period of 6.3 years, participants at high risk of developing advanced AMD (i.e., those with intermediate AMD or those with advanced AMD in one eye) who received the antioxidant supplements had a 28% lower risk of progression to advanced AMD than participants who received a placebo. A follow-up AREDS2 study confirmed the value of this and similar supplement formulations in reducing the progression of AMD over a median follow-up period of 5 years [ 73 ].\nHigh dietary intakes of vitamin C and higher plasma ascorbate concentrations have been associated with a lower risk of cataract formation in some studies [ 2 , 4 ]. In a 5-year prospective cohort study conducted in Japan, higher dietary vitamin C intake was associated with a reduced risk of developing cataracts in a cohort of more than 30,000 adults age 45–64 years [ 74 ]. Results from two case-control studies indicate that vitamin C intakes greater than 300 mg/day reduce the risk of cataract formation by 70%–75% [ 2 , 4 ]. Use of vitamin C supplements, on the other hand, was associated with a 25% higher risk of age-related cataract extraction among a cohort of 24,593 Swedish women age 49–83 years [ 75 ]. These findings applied to study participants who took relatively high-dose vitamin C supplements (approximately 1,000 mg/day) and not to those who took multivitamins containing substantially less vitamin C (approximately 60 mg/day).\nData from clinical trials are limited. In one study, Chinese adults who took daily supplements of 120 mg vitamin C plus 30 mcg molybdenum for 5 years did not have a significantly lower cataract risk [ 76 ]. However, adults age 65–74 years who received 180 mg vitamin C plus 30 mcg molybdenum combined with other nutrients in a multivitamin/mineral supplement had a 43% significantly lower risk of developing nuclear cataracts than those who received a placebo [ 76 ]. In the AREDS study, older individuals who received supplements of 500 mg vitamin C, 400 IU vitamin E, and 15 mg beta-carotene for an average of 6.3 years did not have a significantly lower risk of developing cataracts or of cataract progression than those who received a placebo [ 77 ]. The AREDS2 study, which also tested formulations containing 500 mg vitamin C, confirmed these findings [ 78 ].\nOverall, the currently available evidence does not indicate that vitamin C, taken alone or with other antioxidants, affects the risk of developing AMD, although some evidence indicates that the AREDS formulations might slow AMD progression in people at high risk of developing advanced AMD.\n",
    "The common cold": "In the 1970s Linus Pauling suggested that vitamin C could successfully treat and/or prevent the common cold [ 79 ]. Results of subsequent controlled studies have been inconsistent, resulting in confusion and controversy, although public interest in the subject remains high [ 80 , 81 ].\nA 2007 Cochrane Review examined placebo-controlled trials involving the use of at least 200 mg/day vitamin C taken either continuously as a prophylactic treatment or after the onset of cold symptoms [ 81 ]. Prophylactic use of vitamin C did not significantly reduce the risk of developing a cold in the general population. However, in trials involving marathon runners, skiers, and soldiers exposed to extreme physical exercise and/or cold environments, prophylactic use of vitamin C in doses ranging from 250 mg/day to 1 g/day reduced cold incidence by 50%. In the general population, use of prophylactic vitamin C modestly reduced cold duration by 8% in adults and 14% in children. When taken after the onset of cold symptoms, vitamin C did not affect cold duration or symptom severity.\nOverall, the evidence to date suggests that regular intakes of vitamin C at doses of at least 200 mg/day do not reduce the incidence of the common cold in the general population, but such intakes might be helpful in people exposed to extreme physical exercise or cold environments and those with marginal vitamin C status, such as the elderly and chronic smokers [ 81-83 ]. The use of vitamin C supplements might shorten the duration of the common cold and ameliorate symptom severity in the general population [ 80 , 83 ], possibly due to the antihistamine effect of high-dose vitamin C [ 84 ]. However, taking vitamin C after the onset of cold symptoms does not appear to be beneficial [ 81 ].\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Vitamin C": "Vitamin C has low toxicity and is not believed to cause serious adverse effects at high intakes [ 8 ]. The most common complaints are diarrhea, nausea, abdominal cramps, and other gastrointestinal disturbances due to the osmotic effect of unabsorbed vitamin C in the gastrointestinal tract [ 4 , 8 ].\nIn postmenopausal women with diabetes who participated in the Iowa Women's Health Study, supplemental (but not dietary) vitamin C intake (at least 300 mg/day) was significantly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease mortality [ 59 ]. The mechanism for this effect, if real, is not clear and this finding is from a subgroup of patients in an epidemiological study. No such association has been observed in any other epidemiological study, so the significance of this finding is uncertain. High vitamin C intakes also have the potential to increase urinary oxalate and uric acid excretion, which could contribute to the formation of kidney stones, especially in individuals with renal disorders [ 8 ]. However, studies evaluating the effects on urinary oxalate excretion of vitamin C intakes ranging from 30 mg to 10 g/day have had conflicting results, so it is not clear whether vitamin C actually plays a role in the development of kidney stones [ 8 , 85-87 ]. The best evidence that vitamin C contributes to kidney stone formation is in patients with pre-existing hyperoxaluria [ 23 ].\nDue to the enhancement of nonheme iron absorption by vitamin C, a theoretical concern is that high vitamin C intakes might cause excess iron absorption. In healthy individuals, this does not appear to be a concern [ 8 ]. However, in individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis, chronic consumption of high doses of vitamin C could exacerbate iron overload and result in tissue damage [ 4 , 8 ].\nUnder certain conditions, vitamin C can act as a pro-oxidant, potentially contributing to oxidative damage [ 8 ]. A few studies in vitro have suggested that by acting as a pro-oxidant, supplemental oral vitamin C could cause chromosomal and/or DNA damage and possibly contribute to the development of cancer [ 8 , 88 , 89 ]. However, other studies have not shown increased oxidative damage or increased cancer risk with high intakes of vitamin C [ 8 , 90 ].\nOther reported effects of high intakes of vitamin C include reduced vitamin B12 and copper levels, accelerated metabolism or excretion of ascorbic acid, erosion of dental enamel, and allergic responses [ 8 ]. However, at least some of these conclusions were a consequence of assay artifact, and additional studies have not confirmed these observations [ 8 ].\nThe FNB has established ULs for vitamin C that apply to both food and supplement intakes (Table 3) [ 8 ]. Long-term intakes of vitamin C above the UL may increase the risk of adverse health effects. The ULs do not apply to individuals receiving vitamin C for medical treatment, but such individuals should be under the care of a physician [ 8 ].\n*Formula and food should be the only sources of vitamin C for infants.\n",
    "Chemotherapy and radiation": "The safety and efficacy of the use of vitamin C and other antioxidants during cancer treatment is controversial [ 53 , 91 , 92 ]. Some data indicate that antioxidants might protect tumor cells from the action of radiation therapy and chemotherapeutic agents, such as cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, carmustine, busulfan, thiotepa, and doxorubicin [ 54 , 91 , 93 , 94 ]. At least some of these data have been criticized because of poor study design [ 52 ]. Other data suggest that antioxidants might protect normal tissues from chemotherapy- and radiation-induced damage [ 91 , 93 ] and/or enhance the effectiveness of conventional cancer treatment [ 95 ]. However, due to the physiologically tight control of vitamin C, it is unclear whether oral vitamin C supplements could alter vitamin C concentrations enough to produce the suggested effects. Individuals undergoing chemotherapy or radiation should consult with their oncologist prior to taking vitamin C or other antioxidant supplements, especially in high doses [ 54 ].\n",
    "3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins)": "Vitamin C, in combination with other antioxidants, may attenuate the increase in high-density lipoprotein levels resulting from combination niacin–simvastatin (Zocor) therapy [ 96 , 97 ]. It is not known whether this interaction occurs with other lipid-altering regimens [ 54 ]. Health care providers should monitor lipid levels in individuals taking both statins and antioxidant supplements [ 54 ].\n",
    "Vitamin C and Healthful Diets": "The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Fruits, particularly citrus fruits, fruit juices, and many vegetables are excellent sources of vitamin C. Some ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are fortified with vitamin C. Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Limits alcoholic beverages.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet .\nFor information on vitamin D and COVID-19, see Dietary Supplements in the Time of COVID-19 .\n",
    "Introduction": "Vitamin D (also referred to as calciferol) is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in a few foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. It is also produced endogenously when ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight strike the skin and trigger vitamin D synthesis.\nVitamin D obtained from sun exposure, foods, and supplements is biologically inert and must undergo two hydroxylations in the body for activation. The first hydroxylation, which occurs in the liver, converts vitamin D to 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], also known as calcidiol. The second hydroxylation occurs primarily in the kidney and forms the physiologically active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], also known as calcitriol [ 1 ].\nVitamin D promotes calcium absorption in the gut and maintains adequate serum calcium and phosphate concentrations to enable normal bone mineralization and to prevent hypocalcemic tetany (involuntary contraction of muscles, leading to cramps and spasms). It is also needed for bone growth and bone remodeling by osteoblasts and osteoclasts [ 1-3 ]. Without sufficient vitamin D, bones can become thin, brittle, or misshapen. Vitamin D sufficiency prevents rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Together with calcium, vitamin D also helps protect older adults from osteoporosis.\nVitamin D has other roles in the body, including reduction of inflammation as well as modulation of such processes as cell growth, neuromuscular and immune function, and glucose metabolism [ 1-3 ]. Many genes encoding proteins that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis are modulated in part by vitamin D. Many tissues have vitamin D receptors, and some convert 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D.\nIn foods and dietary supplements, vitamin D has two main forms, D 2 (ergocalciferol) and D 3 (cholecalciferol), that differ chemically only in their side-chain structures. Both forms are well absorbed in the small intestine. Absorption occurs by simple passive diffusion and by a mechanism that involves intestinal membrane carrier proteins [ 4 ]. The concurrent presence of fat in the gut enhances vitamin D absorption, but some vitamin D is absorbed even without dietary fat. Neither aging nor obesity alters vitamin D absorption from the gut [ 4 ].\nSerum concentration of 25(OH)D is currently the main indicator of vitamin D status. It reflects vitamin D produced endogenously and that obtained from foods and supplements [ 1 ]. In serum, 25(OH)D has a fairly long circulating half-life of 15 days [ 1 ]. Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D are reported in both nanomoles per liter (nmol/L) and nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). One nmol/L is equal to 0.4 ng/mL, and 1 ng/mL is equal to 2.5 nmol/L.\nAssessing vitamin D status by measuring serum 25(OH)D concentrations is complicated by the considerable variability of the available assays (the two most common ones involve antibodies or chromatography) used by laboratories that conduct the analyses [ 5 , 6 ]. As a result, a finding can be falsely low or falsely high, depending on the assay used and the laboratory. The international Vitamin D Standardization Program has developed procedures for standardizing the laboratory measurement of 25(OH)D to improve clinical and public health practice [ 5 , 7-10 ].\nIn contrast to 25(OH)D, circulating 1,25(OH)2D is generally not a good indicator of vitamin D status because it has a short half-life measured in hours, and serum levels are tightly regulated by parathyroid hormone, calcium, and phosphate [ 1 ]. Levels of 1,25(OH)2D do not typically decrease until vitamin D deficiency is severe [ 2 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for vitamin D and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by expert committees of NASEM [ 1 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nAn FNB committee established RDAs for vitamin D to indicate daily intakes sufficient to maintain bone health and normal calcium metabolism in healthy people. RDAs for vitamin D are listed in both micrograms (mcg) and International Units (IU); 1 mcg vitamin D is equal to 40 IU (Table 2). Even though sunlight is a major source of vitamin D for some people, the FNB based the vitamin D RDAs on the assumption that people receive minimal sun exposure [ 1 ]. For infants, the FNB committee developed AIs based on the amount of vitamin D that maintains serum 25(OH)D levels above 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) and supports bone development.\nMany other countries around the world and some professional societies have somewhat different guidelines for vitamin D intakes [ 15 ]. These differences are a result of an incomplete understanding of the biology and clinical implications of vitamin D, different purposes for the guidelines (e.g., for public health in a healthy population or for clinical practice), and/or the use in some guidelines of observational studies in addition to randomized clinical trials to establish recommendations [ 9 , 15 ]. For example, the United Kingdom Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition recommends intakes of 10 mcg (400 IU)/day for individuals age 4 years and older [ 16 ]. The Endocrine Society recommends routine vitamin D supplementation for children and teens age 1 to 18 years, people who are pregnant, adults with pre-diabetes, and adults age 75 years and older, but not for healthy adults age 19 to 74 [ 11 , 12 ]. The Endocrine Society does not recommend specific doses but notes that all individuals should adhere to the RDA.\n",
    "Food": "Few foods naturally contain vitamin D. The flesh of fatty fish (such as trout, salmon, tuna, and mackerel) and fish liver oils are among the best sources [ 17 , 1 ]. An animal’s diet affects the amount of vitamin D in its tissues. Beef liver, egg yolks, and cheese have small amounts of vitamin D, primarily in the form of vitamin D 3 and its metabolite 25(OH)D 3 . Mushrooms provide variable amounts of vitamin D 2 [ 17 ]. Some mushrooms available on the market have been treated with UV light to increase their levels of vitamin D 2 . In addition, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved UV-treated mushroom powder as a food additive for use as a source of vitamin D 2 in food products [ 18 ]. Very limited evidence suggests no substantial differences in the bioavailability of vitamin D from various foods [ 19 ].\nAnimal-based foods typically provide some vitamin D in the form of 25(OH)D in addition to vitamin D 3 . The impact of this form on vitamin D status is an emerging area of research. Studies show that 25(OH)D appears to be approximately five times more potent than the parent vitamin for raising serum 25(OH)D concentrations [ 17 , 20 , 21 ]. One study found that when the 25(OH)D content of beef, pork, chicken, turkey, and eggs is taken into account, the total amount of vitamin D in the food is 2 to 18 times higher than the amount in the parent vitamin alone, depending on the food [ 20 ].\nFortified foods provide most of the vitamin D in American diets [ 1 , 22 ]. For example, almost all of the U.S. milk supply is voluntarily fortified with about 3 mcg/cup (120 IU), usually in the form of vitamin D 3 [ 23 ]. In Canada, milk must be fortified with 0.88–1.0 mcg/100 mL (35–40 IU), and the required amount for margarine is at least 13.25 mcg/100 g (530 IU). Other dairy products made from milk, such as cheese and ice cream, are not usually fortified in the United States or Canada. Plant milk alternatives (such as beverages made from soy, almond, or oats) are often fortified with similar amounts of vitamin D to those in fortified cow's milk (about 3 mcg [120 IU]/cup); the Nutrition Facts label lists the actual amount [ 24 ]. Ready-to-eat breakfast cereals often contain added vitamin D, as do some brands of orange juice, yogurt, margarine, and other food products.\nThe United States mandates the fortification of infant formula with 1–2.5 mcg/100 kcal (40–100 IU) vitamin D; 1–2 mcg/100 kcal (40–80 IU) is the required amount in Canada [ 1 ].\nA variety of foods and their vitamin D levels per serving are listed in Table 3.\n* DV = Daily Value. The FDA developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for vitamin D is 20 mcg (800 IU) for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 26 ]. The labels must list vitamin D content in mcg per serving and have the option of also listing the amount in IUs in parentheses. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. ** Vitamin D is in the yolk.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) FoodData Central lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing vitamin D arranged by nutrient content and by food name . However, FoodData Central does not include the amounts of 25(OH)D in foods.\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "Dietary supplements can contain vitamins D 2 or D 3 . Vitamin D 2 is manufactured using UV irradiation of ergosterol in yeast, and vitamin D 3 is typically produced with irradiation of 7-dehydrocholesterol from lanolin obtained from the wool of sheep [ 13 , 31 ]. An animal-free version of vitamin D3 sourced from lichen is also available [ 32 ]. People who avoid all animal-sourced products can contact dietary supplement manufacturers to ask about their sourcing and processing techniques.\nBoth vitamins D 2 and D 3 raise serum 25(OH)D levels, and they seem to have equivalent ability to cure rickets [ 4 ]. In addition, most steps in the metabolism and actions of vitamins D 2 and D 3 are identical. However, most evidence indicates that vitamin D 3 increases serum 25(OH)D levels to a greater extent and maintains these higher levels longer than vitamin D 2 , even though both forms are well absorbed in the gut [ 33-36 ].\nSome studies have used dietary supplements containing the 25(OH)D 3 form of vitamin D. Per equivalent microgram dose, 25(OH)D 3 is three to five times as potent as vitamin D 3 [ 37 , 38 ]. However, no 25(OH)D 3 dietary supplements appear to be available to consumers on the U.S. market at this time [ 32 ].\n",

    "Cancer": "Laboratory and animal studies suggest that vitamin D might inhibit carcinogenesis and slow tumor progression by, for example, promoting cell differentiation and inhibiting metastasis. Vitamin D might also have anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, proapoptotic, and antiangiogenic effects [ 1 , 87 ]. Observational studies and clinical trials provide mixed evidence on whether vitamin D intakes or serum levels affect cancer incidence, progression, or mortality risk.\nSome observational studies show associations between low serum levels of 25(OH)D and increased risks of cancer incidence and death. In a meta-analysis of 16 prospective cohort studies in a total of 137,567 participants who had 8,345 diagnoses of cancer, 5,755 participants died from cancer [ 88 ]. A 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) increase in 25(OH)D levels was associated with an 11% reduction in total cancer incidence rates and, in women but not men, a 24% reduction in cancer mortality rates. A meta-analysis of prospective studies that evaluated the association between serum 25(OH)D levels and cancer incidence (8 studies) or cancer mortality (16 studies) found that cancer risk decreased by 7% and cancer mortality rates decreased by 2% with each 20 nmol/L (8 ng/mL) increase in serum 25(OH)D levels [ 89 ]. Importantly, not all observational studies found higher vitamin D status to be beneficial, and the studies varied considerably in study populations, baseline comorbidities, and measurement of vitamin D levels.\nClinical trial evidence provides some support for the observational findings. For example, three meta-analyses of clinical trial evidence found that vitamin D supplementation does not affect cancer incidence but does significantly reduce total cancer mortality rates by 12%–13% [ 90-92 ]. In the most recent meta-analysis, 10 randomized clinical trials (including the VITAL trial described below) that included 6,537 cancer cases provided 10 to 50 mcg (400 to 2,000 IU) vitamin D 3 daily (six trials) or 500 mcg (20,000 IU)/week to 12,500 mcg (500,000 IU)/year boluses of vitamin D 3 (four trials) [ 91 ]. The study reports included 3–10 years of follow-up data. The vitamin D supplements were associated with serum 25(OH)D levels of 54 to 135 nmol/L (21.6 to 54 ng/mL). Vitamin D supplementation reduced cancer mortality rates by 13%, and most of the benefit occurred with daily supplementation.\nThe VITAL clinical trial that investigated the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the primary prevention of cancer in the general population gave 50 mcg (2,000 IU)/day vitamin D 3 supplements with or without 1,000 mg/day marine omega-3 fatty acids or a placebo for a median of 5.3 years [ 93 ]. The study included 25,871 men age 50 years and older and women age 55 years and older who had no history of cancer, and most had adequate serum 25(OH)D levels at baseline. Rates of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer did not differ significantly between the vitamin D and placebo groups. However, normal-weight participants had greater reductions in cancer incidence and mortality rates than those with overweight or obesity.\nThe Women's Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trial randomized 36,282 postmenopausal women to receive 10 mcg (400 IU) vitamin D 3 plus 1,000 mg calcium daily or a placebo for a mean of 7 years [ 94 ]. Results showed no effect of supplemental vitamin D and calcium on cancer incidence or mortality during the 7-year trial. Similarly, the supplements did not affect cancer incidence over a long-term median follow-up of 22.3 years, but they did reduce cancer mortality by 7% over this period of time [ 95 ].\nA few studies have examined the effect of vitamin D supplementation on specific cancers. Below are brief descriptions of studies of vitamin D and its association with, or effect on, breast, colorectal, lung, pancreatic, and prostate cancers.\nSome observational studies support an inverse association between 25(OH)D levels and breast cancer risk and mortality, but others do not [ 96-99 ]. In the WHI clinical trial described above, vitamin D 3 and calcium supplements did not reduce breast cancer incidence, and 25(OH)D levels at the start of the study were not associated with breast cancer risk [ 100 ].\nIn a subsequent investigation for 4.9 years after the study's end, women who had taken the vitamin D and calcium supplements (many of whom continued to take them) had an 18% lower risk of in situ (noninvasive) breast cancer [ 101 ]. However, women with vitamin D intakes higher than 15 mcg (600 IU)/day at the start of the trial and who received the supplements experienced a 28% increased risk of invasive (but not in situ) breast cancer.\nA large case-control study included 5,706 individuals who developed colorectal cancer and whose 25(OH)D levels were assessed a median of 5.5 years from blood draw to cancer diagnosis and 7,105 matched controls [ 102 ]. The results showed an association between 25(OH)D levels lower than 30 nmol/L (12 ng/mL) and a 31% higher colorectal cancer risk. Levels of 75 to less than 87.5 nmol/L (30 to less than 35 ng/mL) and 87.5 to less than 100 nmol/L (35 to less than 40 ng/mL) were associated with a 19% and 27% lower risk, respectively. The association was substantially stronger in women.\nIn the WHI clinical trial described above, vitamin D 3 and calcium supplements had no effect on rates of colorectal cancer [ 103 ]. In a subsequent investigation for 4.9 years after the study's end, women who had taken the vitamin D and calcium supplements (many of whom continued to take them) still had the same colorectal cancer risk as those who received placebo [ 101 ].\nAnother study included 2,259 healthy individuals age 45 to 75 years who had had one or more serrated polyps (precursor lesions to colorectal cancer) that had been removed [ 104 ]. These participants were randomized to take 25 mcg (1,000 IU) vitamin D 3 , 1,200 mg calcium, both supplements, or a placebo daily for 3–5 years, followed by an additional 3–5 years of observation after participants stopped the treatment. Vitamin D alone did not significantly affect the development of new serrated polyps, but the combination of vitamin D with calcium increased the risk almost fourfold. The VITAL trial found no association between vitamin D supplementation and the risk of colorectal adenomas or serrated polyps [ 105 ].\nA study of cohorts that included 5,313 participants who developed lung cancer and 5,313 matched controls found no association between serum 25(OH)D levels and risk of subsequent lung cancer, even when the investigators analyzed the data by sex, age, race and ethnicity, and smoking status [ 106 ].\nOne study comparing 738 men who developed pancreatic cancer to 738 matched controls found no relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels and risk of pancreatic cancer [ 107 ]. Another study that compared 200 male smokers in Finland with pancreatic cancer to 400 matched controls found that participants in the highest quintile of 25(OH)D levels (more than 65.5 nmol/L [26.2 ng/mL]) had a threefold greater risk of developing pancreatic cancer over 16.7 years than those in the lowest quintile (less than 32 nmol/L [12.8 ng/mL]) [ 108 ]. An investigation that pooled data from 10 studies of cancer in 12,205 men and women found that concentrations of 25(OH)D greater than 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) but less than 100 nmol/L (40 ng/mL) did not reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer. However, the results did show an increased risk of pancreatic cancer with 25(OH)D levels of 100 nmol/L (40 ng/mL) or above [ 109 ].\nResearch to date provides mixed evidence on whether levels of 25(OH)D are associated with the development of prostate cancer. Several studies published in 2014 suggested that high levels of 25(OH)D might increase the risk of prostate cancer. For example, a meta-analysis of 21 studies that included 11,941 men with prostate cancer and 13,870 controls found a 17% higher risk of prostate cancer for participants with higher levels of 25(OH)D [ 110 ]. What constituted a higher level varied by study but was typically at least 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL). In a cohort of 4,733 men, of which 1,731 had prostate cancer, those with 25(OH)D levels of 45–70 nmol/L (18–28 ng/mL) had a significantly lower risk of the disease than men with either lower or higher values [ 111 ]. This U-shaped association was most pronounced for men with the most aggressive forms of prostate cancer. A case-control analysis of 1,695 cases of prostate cancer and 1,682 controls found no associations between 25(OH)D levels and prostate cancer risk [ 112 ]. However, higher serum 25(OH)D levels (at a cut point of 75 nmol/L [30 ng/mL]) were linked to a modestly higher risk of slow-growth prostate cancer and a more substantial lower risk of aggressive disease.\nSince 2014, however, several published studies and meta-analyses have found no relationship between 25(OH)D levels and prostate cancer risk [ 113 , 114 ]. For example, an analysis was conducted of 19 prospective studies that provided data on prediagnostic levels of 25(OH)D for 13,462 men who developed prostate cancer and 20,261 control participants [ 115 ]. Vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency did not increase the risk of prostate cancer, and higher 25(OH)D concentrations were not associated with a lower risk.\nSeveral studies have examined whether levels of 25(OH)D in men with prostate cancer are associated with a lower risk of death from the disease or from any cause. One study included 1,119 men treated for prostate cancer whose plasma 25(OH)D levels were measured 4.9 to 8.6 years after their diagnosis. Among the 198 participants who died (41 deaths were due to prostate cancer), 25(OH)D levels were not associated with risk of death from prostate cancer or any cause [ 116 ]. However, a meta-analysis of seven cohort studies that included 7,808 men with prostate cancer found higher 25(OH)D levels to be significantly associated with lower mortality rates from prostate cancer or any other cause [ 117 ]. A dose-response analysis found that each 20 nmol/L [8 ng/mL] increase in 25(OH)D was associated with a 9% lower risk of both all-cause and prostate cancer-specific mortality.\nFor men with prostate cancer, whether vitamin D supplementation lengthens cancer-related survival is not clear. A meta-analysis of three randomized controlled trials in 1,273 men with prostate cancer found no significant differences in total mortality rates between those receiving vitamin D supplementation (from 10 mcg [400 IU]/day for 28 days to 45 mcg [1,800 IU] given in three doses total at 2-week intervals) and those receiving a placebo [ 118 ].\nThe USPSTF stated that, due to insufficient evidence, it was unable to assess the balance of benefits and harms of supplemental vitamin D to prevent cancer [ 119 ]. Taken together, studies to date do not indicate that vitamin D with or without calcium supplementation reduces the incidence of cancer, but adequate or higher 25(OH)D levels might reduce cancer mortality rates. Further research is needed to determine whether vitamin D inadequacy increases cancer risk, whether greater exposure to the nutrient can prevent cancer, and whether some individuals could have an increased risk of cancer because of their vitamin D status over time.\n",

    "Cardiovascular disease": "Vitamin D helps regulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (and thereby blood pressure), vascular cell growth, and inflammatory and fibrotic pathways [ 120 ]. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with vascular dysfunction, arterial stiffening, left ventricular hypertrophy, and hyperlipidemia [ 121 ]. For these reasons, vitamin D has been linked to heart health and risk of CVD.\nObservational studies support an association between higher serum 25(OH)D levels and a lower risk of CVD incidence and mortality. For example, a meta-analysis included 34 observational studies that followed 180,667 participants (mean age greater than 50 years) for 1.3 to more than 32 years. The results showed that baseline serum 25(OH)D levels were inversely associated with total number of CVD events (including myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and stroke) and mortality risk [ 122 ]. Overall, the risk of CVD events was 10% lower for each 25 nmol/L (10 ng/mL) increase in serum 25(OH)D.\nAnother large observational study that followed 247,574 adults from Denmark for 0–7 years found that levels of 25(OH)D that were low (about 12.5 nmol/L [5 ng/mL]) and high (about 125 nmol/L [50 ng/mL]) were associated with a greater risk of mortality from CVD, stroke, and acute myocardial infarction [ 123 ]. Other meta-analyses of prospective studies have found associations between lower vitamin D status measured by serum 25(OH)D levels or vitamin D intakes and an increased risk of ischemic stroke, ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, and early death [ 124 , 125 ].\nIn contrast to the observational studies, clinical trials have provided little support for the hypothesis that supplemental vitamin D reduces the risk of CVD or CVD mortality. For example, a 3-year trial in New Zealand randomized 5,110 adults (mean age 65.9 years) to a single dose of 5,000 mcg (200,000 IU) vitamin D 3 followed by 2,500 mcg (100,000 IU) each month or a placebo for a median of 3.3 years [ 126 ]. Vitamin D supplementation had no effect on the incidence rate of myocardial infarction, angina, heart failure, arrhythmia, arteriosclerosis, stroke, venous thrombosis, or death from CVD. Similarly, the VITAL clinical trial described above found that vitamin D supplements did not significantly decrease rates of heart attacks, strokes, coronary revascularization, or deaths from cardiovascular causes [ 93 ]. Moreover, the effects did not vary by baseline serum 25(OH)D levels or whether participants took the trial’s omega-3 supplement in addition to vitamin D.\nHowever, another clinical trial designed to investigate bone fracture risk found that 20 mcg (800 IU)/day vitamin D 3 (with or without calcium) or a placebo in 5,292 adults age 70 years and older for a median of 6.2 years offered protection from cardiac failure, but not myocardial infarction or stroke [ 127 ]. In the WHI clinical trial described above, daily supplementation with 10 mcg (400 IU) vitamin D 3 and 1,000 mg calcium did not affect cardiovascular disease risk during the 7-year trial [ 128 ] or during a long-term median follow-up of 22.3 years [ 95 ]. However, during this long-term follow-up period, women who received the supplements had a 6% higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease than those who received placebo [ 95 ].\nHigh serum cholesterol levels and hypertension are two of the main risk factors for CVD. The data on supplemental vitamin D and cholesterol levels are mixed, as shown in one meta-analysis of 41 clinical trials in a total of 3,434 participants (mean age 55 years). The results of this analysis showed that 0.5 mcg (20 IU) to 214 mcg (8,570 IU)/day vitamin D supplementation (mean of 2,795 IU) for 6 weeks to 3 years reduced serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels, but not high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels [ 129 ].\nStudies of the effects of vitamin D supplements on hypertension have also had mixed findings. In one meta-analysis of 46 clinical trials that included 4,541 participants, vitamin D supplements (typically 40 mcg [1,600 IU]/day or less) for a minimum of 4 weeks had no significant effects on systolic or diastolic blood pressure [ 130 ]. In contrast, another meta-analysis of 30 clinical trials in 4,744 participants (mean age 54.5 years) that administered 5 mcg (200 IU) to 300 mcg (12,000 IU)/day vitamin D 3 for a mean of 5.6 months showed that more than 20 mcg (800 IU)/day significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure in normal-weight participants who had hypertension [ 131 ]. However, more than 20 mcg (800 IU)/day vitamin D 3 , when taken with calcium supplements, significantly increased blood pressure in participants with overweight and obesity. Another meta-analysis of genetic studies in 146,581 participants (primarily adults) found that a low vitamin D status increased blood pressure and hypertension risk in people with genetic variants associated with low endogenous production of 25(OH)D [ 132 ].\nOverall, clinical trials show that vitamin D supplementation does not reduce CVD risk, even for people with low 25(OH)D status (below 20 nmol/L [12 ng/mL]) at baseline [ 93 , 126 ].\n",

    "Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D and health": "Although 25(OH)D functions as a biomarker of exposure, the extent to which 25(OH)D levels also serve as a biomarker of effect on the body (i.e., relating to health status or outcomes) is not clear [ 1 , 3 ].\nResearchers have not definitively identified serum concentrations of 25(OH)D associated with deficiency (e.g., rickets), adequacy for bone health, and overall health. After reviewing data on vitamin D needs, an expert committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) concluded that people are at risk of vitamin D deficiency at serum 25(OH)D concentrations less than 30 nmol/L (12 ng/mL; see Table 1 for definitions of deficiency and inadequacy) [ 1 ]. Some people are potentially at risk of inadequacy at 30 to 50 nmol/L (12–20 ng/mL). Levels of 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) or more are sufficient for most people. The FNB committee also noted that serum concentrations greater than 125 nmol/L (50 ng/mL) can be associated with adverse effects [ 1 ] (Table 1). The Endocrine Society has not identified 25(OH)D concentrations associated with vitamin D sufficiency, insufficiency, and deficiency and does not recommend routine testing of 25(OH)D concentrations in healthy individuals [ 11 , 12 ].\nOptimal serum concentrations of 25(OH)D for bone and general health have not been established because they are likely to vary by stage of life, by race and ethnicity, and with each physiological measure used [ 1 , 13 , 14 ]. In addition, although 25(OH)D levels rise in response to increased vitamin D intake, the relationship is nonlinear [ 1 ]. The amount of increase varies, for example, by baseline serum levels and duration of supplementation.\n",
    "Sun exposure": "Most people in the world meet at least some of their vitamin D needs through exposure to sunlight [ 1 ]. Type B UV (UVB) radiation with a wavelength of approximately 290–320 nanometers penetrates uncovered skin and converts cutaneous 7-dehydrocholesterol to previtamin D 3 , which in turn becomes vitamin D 3 . Season, time of day, length of day, cloud cover, smog, skin melanin content, and sunscreen are among the factors that affect UV radiation exposure and vitamin D synthesis. Older people and people with dark skin are less able to produce vitamin D from sunlight [ 1 ]. UVB radiation does not penetrate glass, so exposure to sunshine indoors through a window does not produce vitamin D [ 27 ].\nThe factors that affect UV radiation exposure, individual responsiveness, and uncertainties about the amount of sun exposure needed to maintain adequate vitamin D levels make it difficult to provide guidelines on how much sun exposure is required for sufficient vitamin D synthesis [ 15 , 28 ]. Some expert bodies and vitamin D researchers suggest, for example, that approximately 5–30 minutes of sun exposure, particularly between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., either daily or at least twice a week to the face, arms, hands, and legs without sunscreen usually leads to sufficient vitamin D synthesis [ 13 , 15 , 28 ]. Moderate use of commercial tanning beds that emit 2% to 6% UVB radiation is also effective [ 13 , 29 ].\nHowever, despite the importance of the sun for vitamin D synthesis, limiting skin exposure to sunlight and UV radiation from tanning beds is prudent [ 28 ]. UV radiation is a carcinogen, and UV exposure is the most preventable cause of skin cancer. Federal agencies and national organizations advise taking photoprotective measures to reduce the risk of skin cancer, including using sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher, whenever people are exposed to the sun [ 28 , 30 ]. Sunscreens with an SPF of 8 or more appear to block vitamin D-producing UV rays. In practice, however, people usually do not apply sufficient amounts of sunscreen, cover all sun-exposed skin, or reapply sunscreen regularly. Their skin probably synthesizes some vitamin D, even with typically applied sunscreen amounts [ 1 , 28 ].\n",
    "Vitamin D Intakes and Status": "Most people in the United States consume less than recommended amounts of vitamin D. An analysis of data from the 2015–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that average daily vitamin D intakes from foods and beverages were 5.1 mcg (204 IU) in men, 4.2 mcg (168 IU) in women, and 4.9 mcg (196 IU) in children age 2–19 years [ 39 ]. In fact, 2013–2016 NHANES data showed that 92% of men, more than 97% of women, and 94% of people age 1 year and older ingested less than the EAR of 10 mcg (400 IU) of vitamin D from food and beverages [ 40 ].\nThe analysis of 2015–2016 data also showed that 28% of all individuals age 2 years and older in the United States took a dietary supplement containing vitamin D [ 39 ]. In addition, 26% of participants age 2–5 years and 14% of those age 6–11 years took supplements; rates increased with age from 10% of those age 12–19 years to 49% of men and 59% of women age 60 and older. Total vitamin D intakes were three times higher with supplement use than with diet alone; the mean intake from foods and beverages alone for individuals age 2 and older was 4.8 mcg (192 IU) but increased to 19.9 mcg (796 IU) when dietary supplements were included.\nSome people take very high doses of vitamin D supplements. In 2013–2014, an estimated 3.2% of the U.S. adult population took supplements containing 100 mcg (4,000 IU) or more vitamin D [ 41 ].\nOne might expect a large proportion of the U.S. population to have vitamin D inadequacy on the basis of vitamin D intakes from foods, beverages, and even dietary supplements. However, comparing vitamin D intakes to serum 25(OH)D levels is problematic. One reason is that sun exposure affects vitamin D status, so serum 25(OH)D levels are usually higher than would be predicted on the basis of vitamin D dietary intakes alone [ 1 ]. Another reason is that animal foods contain some 25(OH)D. This form of vitamin D is not included in intake surveys and is considerably more potent than vitamins D 2 or D 3 at raising serum 25(OH)D levels [ 42 ].\nAn analysis of NHANES 2011–2014 data on serum 25(OH)D levels found that most people in the United States age 1 year and older had sufficient vitamin D intakes according to the FNB thresholds [ 43 ]. However, 18% were at risk of inadequacy (levels of 30–49 nmol/L [12–19.6 ng/mL]), and 5% were at risk of deficiency (levels below 30 nmol/L [12 ng/mL]). Four percent had levels higher than 125 nmol/L (50 ng/mL). Proportions at risk of deficiency were lowest among children age 1–5 years (0.5%), peaked at 7.6% in adults age 20–39 years, and fell to 2.9% among adults age 60 years and older; patterns were similar for risks of inadequacy. Rates of deficiency varied by race and ethnicity: 17.5% of non-Hispanic Blacks were at risk of vitamin D deficiency, as were 7.6% of non-Hispanic Asians, 5.9% of Hispanics, and 2.1% of non-Hispanic White people. Again, the pattern was similar for the risk of inadequacy. Vitamin D status in the United States remained stable in the decade between 2003–2004 and 2013–2014.\n",
    "Vitamin D Deficiency": "People can develop vitamin D deficiency when usual intakes are lower over time than recommended levels, exposure to sunlight is limited, the kidneys cannot convert 25(OH)D to its active form, or absorption of vitamin D from the digestive tract is inadequate. Diets low in vitamin D are more common in people who have milk allergy or lactose intolerance and those who consume an ovo-vegetarian or vegan diet [ 1 ].\nIn children, vitamin D deficiency is manifested as rickets, a disease characterized by a failure of bone tissue to become properly mineralized, resulting in soft bones and skeletal deformities [ 44 ]. In addition to bone deformities and pain, severe rickets can cause failure to thrive, developmental delay, hypocalcemic seizures, tetanic spasms, cardiomyopathy, and dental abnormalities [ 45 , 46 ].\nProlonged exclusive breastfeeding without vitamin D supplementation can cause rickets in infants, and, in the United States, rickets is most common among breastfed Black infants and children [ 47 ]. In one Minnesota county, the incidence rate of rickets in children younger than 3 years in the decade beginning in 2000 was 24.1 per 100,000 [ 48 ]. Rickets occurred mainly in Black children who were breastfed longer, were born with low birthweight, weighed less, and were shorter than other children. The incidence rate of rickets in the infants and children (younger than 7) seen by 2,325 pediatricians throughout Canada was 2.9 per 100,000 in 2002–2004, and almost all patients with rickets had been breastfed [ 49 ].\nThe fortification of milk (a good source of calcium) and other staples, such as breakfast cereals and margarine, with vitamin D beginning in the 1930s along with the use of cod liver oil made rickets rare in the United States [ 28 , 50 ]. However, the incidence of rickets is increasing globally, even in the United States and Europe, especially among immigrants from African, Middle-Eastern, and Asian countries [ 51 ]. Possible explanations for this increase include genetic differences in vitamin D metabolism, dietary preferences, and behaviors that lead to less sun exposure [ 45 , 46 ].\nIn adults and adolescents, vitamin D deficiency can lead to osteomalacia, in which existing bone is incompletely or defectively mineralized during the remodeling process, resulting in weak bones [ 46 ]. Signs and symptoms of osteomalacia are similar to those of rickets and include bone deformities and pain, hypocalcemic seizures, tetanic spasms, and dental abnormalities [ 45 ].\nScreening for vitamin D status is becoming a more common part of the routine laboratory bloodwork ordered by primary-care physicians, irrespective of any indications for this practice [ 6 , 52-54 ]. No studies have examined whether such screening for vitamin D deficiency results in improved health outcomes [ 55 ]. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults [ 6 ]. It added that no national professional organization recommends population screening for vitamin D deficiency.\n",
    "Groups at Risk of Vitamin D Inadequacy": "Obtaining sufficient vitamin D from natural (nonfortified) food sources alone is difficult. For many people, consuming vitamin D-fortified foods and exposing themselves to some sunlight are essential for maintaining a healthy vitamin D status. However, some groups might need dietary supplements to meet their vitamin D requirements. The following groups are among those most likely to have inadequate vitamin D status.\n",
    "Breastfed infants": "Consumption of human milk alone does not ordinarily enable infants to meet vitamin D requirements, because it provides less than 0.6 to 2.0 mcg/L (25 to 78 IU/L) [ 1 , 56 , 57 ]. The vitamin D content of human milk is related to the mother’s vitamin D status; studies suggest that the breastmilk of mothers who take daily supplements containing at least 50 mcg (2,000 IU) vitamin D 3 have higher levels of the nutrient [ 57 , 58 ].\nAlthough UVB exposure can produce vitamin D in infants, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) advises parents to keep infants younger than 6 months out of direct sunlight, dress them in protective clothing and hats, and apply sunscreen on small areas of exposed skin when sun exposure is unavoidable [ 59 ]. The AAP recommends 10 mcg (400 IU)/day vitamin D supplements for exclusively and partially breastfed infants starting shortly after birth and lasting until they are weaned and consume at least 1,000 mL/day vitamin D-fortified formula or whole milk [ 57 ]. The AAP also recommends 10 mcg (400 IU)/day supplemental vitamin D for all infants who are not breastfed and ingest less than 1,000 mL/day vitamin D-fortified formula or milk. An analysis of NHANES 2009–2016 data found that only 20.5% of breastfed infants and 31.1% of infants who were not breastfed ingested these recommended amounts of supplements [ 60 ].\n",
    "People with limited sun exposure": "Homebound individuals; people who wear long robes, dresses, or head coverings for religious reasons; and people with occupations that limit sun exposure are among the groups that are unlikely to obtain adequate amounts of vitamin D from sunlight [ 62 ]. The use of sunscreen also limits vitamin D synthesis from sunlight. However, because the extent and frequency of sunscreen use are unknown, the role that sunscreen may play in reducing vitamin D synthesis is unclear [ 1 ].\n",
    "People with dark skin": "Greater amounts of the pigment melanin in the epidermal layer of the skin result in darker skin and reduce the skin’s ability to produce vitamin D from sunlight [ 1 ]. Black Americans, for example, typically have lower serum 25(OH)D levels than White Americans. However, whether these lower levels in persons with dark skin have significant health consequences is not clear [ 14 ]. Those of African American ancestry, for example, have lower rates of bone fracture and osteoporosis than do Whites (see the section below on bone health and osteoporosis).\n",
    "People with conditions that limit fat absorption": "Because vitamin D is fat soluble, its absorption depends on the gut’s ability to absorb dietary fat [ 4 ]. Fat malabsorption is associated with medical conditions that include some forms of liver disease, cystic fibrosis, celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, and ulcerative colitis [ 1 , 63 ]. In addition to having an increased risk of vitamin D deficiency, people with these conditions might not eat certain foods, such as dairy products (many of which are fortified with vitamin D), or eat only small amounts of these foods. Individuals who have difficulty absorbing dietary fat might therefore require vitamin D supplementation [ 63 ].\n",
    "People with obesity or who have undergone gastric bypass surgery": "Individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more have lower serum 25(OH)D levels than individuals without obesity. Obesity does not affect the skin’s capacity to synthesize vitamin D. However, greater amounts of subcutaneous fat sequester more of the vitamin [ 1 ]. People with obesity might need greater intakes of vitamin D to achieve 25(OH)D levels similar to those of people with normal weight [ 1 , 64 , 65 ].\nIndividuals with obesity who have undergone gastric bypass surgery can also become vitamin D deficient. In this procedure, part of the upper small intestine, where vitamin D is absorbed, is bypassed, and vitamin D that is mobilized into the bloodstream from fat stores might not raise 25(OH)D to adequate levels over time [ 66 , 67 ]. Various expert groups—including the American Association of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, The Obesity Society, and the British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society—have developed guidelines on vitamin D screening, monitoring, and replacement before and after bariatric surgery [ 66 , 68 ]\n",
    "Vitamin D and Health": "The FNB committee that established DRIs for vitamin D found that the evidence was inadequate or too contradictory to conclude that the vitamin had any effect on a long list of potential health outcomes (e.g., on resistance to chronic diseases or functional measures), except for measures related to bone health. Similarly, in a review of data from nearly 250 studies published between 2009 and 2013, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality concluded that no relationship could be firmly established between vitamin D and health outcomes other than bone health [ 69 ]. However, because research has been conducted on vitamin D and numerous health outcomes, this section focuses on seven diseases, conditions, and interventions in which vitamin D might be involved: bone health and osteoporosis, cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), depression, multiple sclerosis (MS), type 2 diabetes, and weight loss.\nMost of the studies described in this section measured serum 25(OH)D levels using various methods that were not standardized by comparing them to the best methods. Use of unstandardized 25(OH)D measures can raise questions about the accuracy of the results and about the validity of conclusions drawn from studies that use such measures and, especially, from meta-analyses that pool data from many studies that use different unstandardized measures [ 5 , 9 , 70 ]. More information about assay standardization is available from the Vitamin D Standardization Program webpage.\n",
    "Bone health and osteoporosis": "Bone is constantly being remodeled. However, as people age—and particularly in women during menopause—bone breakdown rates overtake rates of bone building. Over time, bone density can decline, and osteoporosis can eventually develop [ 71 ].\nMore than 53 million adults in the United States have or are at risk of developing osteoporosis, which is characterized by low bone mass and structural deterioration of bone tissue that increases bone fragility and the risk of bone fractures [ 72 ]. About 2.3 million osteoporotic fractures occurred in the United States in 2015 [ 73 ]. Osteoporosis is, in part, a long-term effect of calcium and/or vitamin D insufficiency, in contrast to rickets and osteomalacia, which result from vitamin D deficiency. Osteoporosis is most often associated with inadequate calcium intakes, but insufficient vitamin D intakes contribute to osteoporosis by reducing calcium absorption [ 1 ].\nBone health also depends on support from the surrounding muscles to assist with balance and postural sway and thereby reduce the risk of falling. Vitamin D is also needed for the normal development and growth of muscle fibers. In addition, inadequate vitamin D levels can adversely affect muscle strength and lead to muscle weakness and pain (myopathy) [ 1 ].\nMost trials of the effects of vitamin D supplements on bone health also included calcium supplements, so isolating the effects of each nutrient is difficult. In addition, studies provided different amounts of nutrients and used different dosing schedules.\nAmong postmenopausal women and older men, many clinical trials have shown that supplements of both vitamin D and calcium result in small increases in bone mineral density throughout the skeleton [ 1 , 74 ]. They also help reduce fracture rates in institutionalized older people. However, the evidence on the impact of vitamin D and calcium supplements on fractures in community-dwelling individuals is inconsistent.\nThe USPSTF evaluated 11 randomized clinical trials of vitamin D and/or calcium supplementation in a total of 51,419 healthy, community-dwelling adults age 50 years and older who did not have osteoporosis, vitamin D deficiency, or prior fractures [ 75 , 76 ]. It concluded that the current evidence was insufficient to evaluate the benefits and harms of supplementation to prevent fractures. In addition, the USPSTF recommended against supplementation with 10 mcg (400 IU) or less of vitamin D and 1,000 mg or less of calcium to prevent fractures in this population, but it could not determine the balance of benefits and harms from higher doses.\nThe USPSTF also reviewed the seven published studies on the effects of vitamin D supplementation (two of them also included calcium supplementation) on the risk of falls in community-dwelling adults age 65 years or older who did not have osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency. It concluded with moderate certainty that vitamin D supplementation does not reduce the numbers of falls or injuries, such as fractures, resulting from falls [ 77 , 78 ]. Another recent systematic review also found that vitamin D and calcium supplements had no beneficial effects on fractures, falls, or bone mineral density [ 79 , 80 ]. In contrast, a meta-analysis of six trials in 49,282 older adults found that daily vitamin D (10 or 20 mcg [400 IU or 800 IU]/day) and calcium (800 or 1,200 mg/day) supplementation for a mean of 5.9 years reduced the risk of any fracture by 6% and of hip fracture by 16% [ 81 ].\nOne systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 randomized, controlled trials published through 2018 of vitamin D supplementation alone (10–20 mcg [400–800 IU]/day or more at least every week or as rarely as once a year) for 9 months to 5 years found that the supplements provided no protection from fractures in 34,243 older adults [ 81 ].\nMore recently, a 2022 ancillary study of the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL; described in the Cancer section below) investigated whether supplemental vitamin D 3 (50 mcg [2,000 IU]/day) would lower the risk of fractures in 25,871 generally healthy men age 50 years and older and women age 55 years and older over a median follow-up of 5.3 years [ 82 ]. The mean age of all participants was 67.1 years; 50.6% were women and 20.2% were Black. Most participants were vitamin D sufficient; at baseline, only 2.4% had serum 25(OH)D levels less than 30 nmol/L (12 ng/mL), and 12.9% less than 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL). Vitamin D supplementation did not lower the risk of total fractures, hip fractures, or nonvertebral fractures as compared with placebo. No substantial between-group differences in fracture incidence were found by race, ethnic group, BMI, age, baseline 25(OH)D levels, or whether participants took supplemental calcium, were at high fracture risk, or had a history of fragility fractures.\nBone mineral density, bone mass, and fracture risk are correlated with serum 25(OH)D levels in White Americans and Mexican Americans, but not in Black Americans [ 14 , 83 ]. Factors such as adiposity, skin pigmentation, vitamin D binding protein polymorphisms, and genetics contribute to differences in 25(OH)D levels between Black and White Americans.\nOne clinical trial randomized 260 Black women age 60 years and older (mean age 68.2 years) to receive 60 to 120 mcg (2,400 to 4,800 IU) per day vitamin D 3 supplementation to maintain serum 25(OH)D levels above 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) for 3 years [ 84 ]. The results showed no association between 25(OH)D levels or vitamin D dose and the risk of falling in the 184 participants who completed the study. In fact, Black Americans might have a greater risk than White Americans of falls and fractures with daily vitamin D intakes of 50 mcg (2,000 IU) or more [ 14 ]. Furthermore, the bone health of older Black American women does not appear to benefit from raising serum 25(OH)D levels beyond 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) [ 84 ].\nStudies examining the effects of supplemental vitamin D on muscle strength and on rate of decline in muscle function have had inconsistent results [ 55 ]. One recent clinical trial, for example, randomized 78 frail and near-frail adults age 65 years and older to receive 20 mcg (800 IU) vitamin D 3 , 10 mcg 25(OH)D, or placebo daily for 6 months. The groups showed no significant differences in measures of muscle strength or performance [ 85 ]. Another study randomized 100 community-dwelling men and women age 60 years and older (most were White) with serum 25(OH)D levels of 50 nmol/L (20 ng/ml) or less to 800 IU vitamin D 3 or placebo for 1 year [ 86 ]. Participants in the treatment group whose serum 25(OH)D level was less than 70 nmol/L (28 ng/ml) after 4 months received an additional 800 IU/day vitamin D 3 . Despite increasing serum 25(OH)D levels to an average of more than 80 nmol/L (32 ng/ml), vitamin D supplementation did not affect lower-extremity power, strength, or lean mass.\nAll adults should consume recommended amounts of vitamin D and calcium from foods and supplements if needed. Older women and men should consult their health care providers about their needs for both nutrients as part of an overall plan to maintain bone health and to prevent or treat osteoporosis.\n",
    "Depression": "Vitamin D is involved in various brain processes, and vitamin D receptors are present on neurons and glia in areas of the brain thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of depression [ 133 ].\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 observational studies that included a total of 31,424 adults (mean age ranging from 27.5 to 77 years) found an association between deficient or low levels of 25(OH)D and depression [ 133 ].\nClinical trials, however, do not support these findings. For example, a meta-analysis of nine trials with a total of 4,923 adult participants diagnosed with depression or depressive symptoms found no significant reduction in symptoms after supplementation with vitamin D [ 134 ]. The trials administered different amounts of vitamin D (ranging from 10 mcg [400 IU]/day to 1,000 mcg [40,000 IU]/week). They also had different study durations (5 days to 5 years), mean participant ages (range, 22 years to 75 years), and baseline 25(OH)D levels; furthermore, some but not all studies administered concurrent antidepressant medications.\nThree trials conducted since that meta-analysis also found no effect of vitamin D supplementation on depressive symptoms. One trial included 206 adults (mean age 52 years) who were randomized to take a bolus dose of 2,500 mcg (100,000 IU) vitamin D 3 followed by 500 mcg (20,000 IU)/week or a placebo for 4 months [ 135 ]. Most participants had minimal or mild depression, had a low mean baseline 25(OH) level of 33.8 nmol/L (13.5 ng/mL), and were not taking antidepressants. The second trial included 155 adults age 60–80 years who had clinically relevant depressive symptoms, no major depressive disorder, and serum 25(OH)D levels less than 50 to 70 nmol/L (20 to 28 ng/mL) depending on the season; in addition, they were not taking antidepressants [ 136 , 137 ]. Participants were randomized to take either 30 mcg (1,200 IU)/day vitamin D 3 or a placebo for 1 year. In the VITAL trial described above, 16,657 men and women 50 years of age and older with no history of depression and 1,696 with an increased risk of recurrent depression (that had not been medically treated for the past 2 years) were randomized to take 50 mcg (2,000 IU)/day vitamin D 3 (with or without fish oil) or a placebo for a median of 5.3 years [ 138 ]. The groups showed no significant differences in the incidence and recurrent rates of depression, clinically relevant depressive symptoms, or changes in mood scores.\nOverall, clinical trials did not find that vitamin D supplements helped prevent or treat depressive symptoms or mild depression, especially in middle-age to older adults who were not taking prescription antidepressants. No studies have evaluated whether vitamin D supplements may benefit individuals under medical care for clinical depression who have low or deficient 25(OH)D levels and are taking antidepressant medication.\n",
    "Multiple sclerosis": "MS is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that damages the myelin sheath surrounding and protecting nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. This damage hinders or blocks messages between the brain and body, leading to clinical features, such as vision loss, motor weakness, spasticity, ataxia, tremor, sensory loss, and cognitive impairment [ 139 , 140 ]. Some people with MS eventually lose the ability to write, speak, or walk.\nThe geographical distribution of MS around the world is unequal. Few people near the equator develop the disease, whereas the prevalence is higher further north and south. This uneven distribution has led to speculation that lower vitamin D levels in people who have less sunlight exposure might predispose them to the disease [ 140 ].\nMany epidemiological and genetic studies have shown an association between MS and low 25(OH)D levels before and after the disease begins [ 140 ]. Observational studies suggest that adequate vitamin D levels might reduce the risk of contracting MS and, once MS is present, decrease the risk of relapse and slow the disease's progression [ 141 ]. One study, for example, tested 25(OH)D levels in 1,092 women in Finland an average of 9 years before their MS diagnosis and compared their outcomes with those of 2,123 similar women who did not develop MS [ 142 ]. More than half the women who developed MS had deficient or insufficient vitamin D levels. Women with 25(OH)D levels of less than 30 nmol/L (12 ng/mL) had a 43% higher MS risk than women with levels of 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) or higher. Among the women with two or more serum 25(OH)D samples taken before diagnosis (which reduced random measurement variation), a 50 nmol/L increase in 25(OH)D was associated with a 41% reduced risk of MS, and 25(OH)D levels less than 30 nmol/L were associated with an MS risk that was twice as high as levels of 50 nmol/L or higher.\nTwo earlier prospective studies of similar design—one in the United States with 444 non-Hispanic White individuals [ 143 ] and the other with 576 individuals in northern Sweden [ 144 ]—found that levels of 25(OH)D greater than 99.1 nmol/L (39.6 ng/mL) and at least 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL), respectively, were associated with a 61%–62% lower risk of MS.\nNo clinical trials have examined whether vitamin D supplementation can prevent the onset of MS, but several have investigated whether supplemental vitamin D can help manage the disease. A 2018 Cochrane Review analyzed 12 such trials that had a total of 933 participants with MS; the reviewers judged all of these trials to be of low quality [ 140 ]. Overall, vitamin D supplementation, when compared with placebo administration, had no effect on relevant clinical outcomes, such as recurrent relapse or worsened disability.\nExperts have reached no firm consensus on whether vitamin D can help prevent MS given the lack of clinical trial evidence [ 145 ]. In addition, studies have not consistently shown that vitamin D supplementation tempers the signs and symptoms of active MS or reduces rates of relapse.\n",
    "Type 2 diabetes": "Vitamin D plays a role in glucose metabolism. It stimulates insulin secretion via the vitamin D receptor on pancreatic beta cells and reduces peripheral insulin resistance through vitamin D receptors in the muscles and liver [ 146 ]. Vitamin D might be involved in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes through its effects on glucose metabolism and insulin signaling as well as its ability to reduce inflammation and improve pancreatic beta-cell function [ 147 , 148 ].\nObservational studies have linked lower serum 25(OH)D levels to an increased risk of diabetes, but their results might have been confounded by the fact that many participants were overweight or had obesity and were therefore more predisposed to developing diabetes and having lower 25(OH)D levels [ 1 ]. A review of 71 observational studies in adults with and without type 2 diabetes from 16 countries found a significant inverse relationship between vitamin D status and blood sugar levels in participants who did and did not have diabetes [ 149 ].\nIn contrast to observational studies, clinical trials provide little support for the benefits of vitamin D supplementation for glucose homeostasis. One trial included 65 adult men and women (mean age 32 years) with overweight or obesity who were otherwise healthy, did not have diabetes, and had low serum vitamin D levels (at or below 50 nmol/L [20 ng/mL]) [ 150 ]. The investigators randomly assigned participants to receive either a bolus oral dose of 2,500 mcg (100,000 IU) vitamin D 3 followed by 100 mcg (4,000 IU)/day or a placebo for 16 weeks. In the 54 participants who completed the study, vitamin D supplementation did not improve insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion in comparison with placebo.\nOne systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated 35 clinical trials that included 43,407 adults with normal glucose tolerance, prediabetes, or type 2 diabetes who received a median of 83 mcg (3,332 IU)/day vitamin D supplements or placebo for a median of 16 weeks [ 151 ]. Vitamin D had no significant effects on glucose homeostasis, insulin secretion or resistance, or hemoglobin A1c levels (a measure of average blood sugar levels over the previous 2–3 months), irrespective of the study population, vitamin D dose, or trial quality.\nSeveral trials have investigated whether vitamin D supplementation can prevent the transition from prediabetes to diabetes in patients with adequate 25(OH)D levels, and all have had negative results. In a trial in Norway, 511 men and women age 25–80 years (mean age 62 years) with prediabetes received 500 mcg (20,000 IU) vitamin D 3 or a placebo each week for 5 years [ 152 ]. The results showed no significant differences in rates of progression to type 2 diabetes; in serum glucose, insulin, or hemoglobin A1c levels; or in measures of insulin resistance. At baseline, participants had an adequate mean serum 25(OH)D level of 60 nmol/L (24 ng/mL).\nThe largest trial to date of vitamin D supplements for diabetes prevention randomized 2,423 men and women age 25 years and older (mean age 60 years) with prediabetes and overweight or obesity (mean BMI of 32.1) to 100 mcg (4,000 IU)/day vitamin D 3 or placebo for a median of 2.5 years [ 148 ]. Most participants (78%) had adequate serum levels of vitamin D at baseline (at least 50 nmol/L [20 ng/mL]). Vitamin D did not significantly prevent the development of diabetes in comparison with placebo. However, a post hoc analysis showed a 62% lower incidence of diabetes among participants with low baseline serum 25(OH)D levels (less than 30 nmol/L [12 ng/mL]) who took the vitamin D supplement than among those who took the placebo [ 148 , 153 ].\nStudies have also assessed the value of vitamin D supplementation for managing diabetes, and they have found that the vitamin offers limited benefits. One meta-analysis of 20 clinical trials compared the effects of 0.5 mcg (20 IU)/day to 1,250 mcg (50,000 IU)/week vitamin D supplementation for 2–6 months with those of placebo on glycemic control in 2,703 adults from around the world who had diabetes [ 146 ]. The vitamin D reduced insulin resistance to a small but significant degree, especially in people taking more than 50 mcg (2,000 IU)/day who were vitamin D deficient at baseline, had good glycemic control, did not have obesity, and were of Middle Eastern ethnicity. However, the supplementation had no significant effects on fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, or fasting insulin levels.\nClinical trials to date provide little evidence that vitamin D supplementation helps maintain glucose homeostasis, reduces the risk of progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes, or helps manage the disease, particularly in vitamin D-replete individuals.\n",
    "Weight loss": "Observational studies indicate that greater body weights are associated with lower vitamin D status, and individuals with obesity frequently have marginal or deficient circulating 25(OH)D levels [ 154 ]. However, clinical trials do not support a cause-and-effect relationship between vitamin D and weight loss.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of 15 weight-loss intervention studies that used caloric restriction, exercise, or both, but not necessarily vitamin D supplementation or other treatments, found that people who lost weight had significantly greater increases in serum 25(OH)D levels than those who maintained their weight [ 155 ]. In another study, 10 mcg (400 IU)/day vitamin D and 1,000 mg/day calcium supplementation slightly, but significantly, reduced weight gain amounts in comparison with placebo in postmenopausal women, especially those with a baseline total calcium intake of less than 1,200 mg/day [ 156 ]. However, a meta-analysis of 12 vitamin D supplementation trials (including 5 in which body composition measurements were primary outcomes) found that vitamin D supplements without calorie restriction did not affect body weight or fat mass when the results were compared with those of placebo [ 157 ].\nOverall, the available research suggests that consuming higher amounts of vitamin D or taking vitamin D supplements does not promote weight loss.\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Vitamin D": "Excess amounts of vitamin D are toxic. Because vitamin D increases calcium absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, vitamin D toxicity results in marked hypercalcemia (total calcium greater than 11.1 mg/dL, beyond the normal range of 8.4 to 10.2 mg/dL), hypercalciuria, and high serum 25(OH)D levels (typically greater than 375 nmol/l [150 ng/mL]) [ 158 ]. Hypercalcemia, in turn, can lead to nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness, neuropsychiatric disturbances, pain, loss of appetite, dehydration, polyuria, excessive thirst, and kidney stones.\nIn extreme cases, vitamin D toxicity causes renal failure, calcification of soft tissues throughout the body (including in coronary vessels and heart valves), cardiac arrhythmias, and even death. Vitamin D toxicity has been caused by consumption of dietary supplements that contained excessive vitamin D amounts because of manufacturing errors, that were taken inappropriately or in excessive amounts, or that were incorrectly prescribed by physicians, [ 158-160 ].\nExperts do not believe that excessive sun exposure results in vitamin D toxicity because thermal activation of previtamin D 3 in the skin gives rise to various non-vitamin D forms that limit formation of vitamin D 3 . Some vitamin D 3 is also converted to nonactive forms [ 1 ]. However, frequent use of tanning beds, which provide artificial UV radiation, can lead to 25(OH)D levels well above 375–500 nmol/L (150–200 ng/mL) [ 161-163 ].\nThe combination of high intakes of calcium (about 2,100 mg/day from food and supplements) with moderate amounts of vitamin D (about 19 mcg [765 IU]/day from food and supplements) increased the risk of kidney stones by 17% over 7 years among 36,282 postmenopausal women who were randomly assigned to take 1,000 mg/day calcium and 10 mcg (400 IU)/day vitamin D or a placebo [ 164 ]. However, other, shorter (from 24 weeks to 5 years) clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation alone or with calcium in adults found greater risks of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria, but not of kidney stones [ 165 , 166 ].\nThe FNB established ULs for vitamin D in 2010 (Table 4) [ 1 ]. While acknowledging that signs and symptoms of toxicity are unlikely at daily intakes below 250 mcg (10,000 IU), the FNB noted that even vitamin D intakes lower than the ULs might have adverse health effects over time. The FNB recommended avoiding serum 25(OH)D levels above approximately 125–150 nmol/L (50–60 ng/mL), and it found that even lower serum levels (approximately 75–120 nmol/L [30–48 ng/mL]) are associated with increases in rates of all-cause mortality, risk of cancer at some sites (e.g., pancreas), risk of cardiovascular events, and number of falls and fractures among older adults.\n",
    "Orlistat": "The weight-loss drug orlistat (Xenical and alli), together with a reduced-fat diet, can reduce the absorption of vitamin D from food and supplements, leading to lower 25(OH)D levels [ 167-170 ].\n",
    "Statins": "Statin medications reduce cholesterol synthesis. Because endogenous vitamin D is derived from cholesterol, statins may also reduce vitamin D synthesis [ 170 ]. In addition, high intakes of vitamin D, especially from supplements, might reduce the potency of atorvastatin (Lipitor), lovastatin (Altoprev and Mevacor), and simvastatin (FloLipid and Zocor), because these statins and vitamin D appear to compete for the same metabolizing enzyme [ 170-173 ].\n",
    "Steroids": "Corticosteroid medications, such as prednisone (Deltasone, Rayos, and Sterapred), are often prescribed to reduce inflammation. These medications can reduce calcium absorption and impair vitamin D metabolism [ 174-176 ]. In the NHANES 2001–2006 survey, 25(OH)D deficiency (less than 25 nmol/L [10 ng/mL]) was more than twice as common among children and adults who reported oral steroid use (11%) than in nonusers (5%) [ 177 ].\n",
    "Thiazide diuretics": "Thiazide diuretics (e.g., Hygroton, Lozol, and Microzide) decrease urinary calcium excretion. The combination of these diuretics with vitamin D supplements (which increase intestinal calcium absorption) might lead to hypercalcemia, especially among older adults and individuals with compromised renal function or hyperparathyroidism [ 170 , 178 , 179 ].\n",
    "Vitamin D and Healthful Diets": "The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Milk, many ready-to-eat cereals, and some brands of yogurt and orange juice are fortified with vitamin D. Cheese naturally contains small amounts of vitamin D. Vitamin D is added to some margarines. Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. Fatty fish, such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel, are very good sources of vitamin D. Beef liver and egg yolks have small amounts of vitamin D. Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Limits alcoholic beverages. Stays within your daily calorie needs.\nMilk, many ready-to-eat cereals, and some brands of yogurt and orange juice are fortified with vitamin D. Cheese naturally contains small amounts of vitamin D.

    "Table of Contents": "Introduction Recommended Intakes Sources of Vitamin E Vitamin E Intakes and Status Vitamin E Deficiency Vitamin E and Health Health Risks from Excessive Vitamin E Interactions with Medications Vitamin E and Healthful Diets References Disclaimer\nThis is a fact sheet intended for health professionals.  For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet .\n",
    "Introduction": "Vitamin E is found naturally in some foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. Vitamin E is the collective name for a group of fat-soluble compounds with distinctive antioxidant activities [ 1 ].\nNaturally occurring vitamin E exists in eight chemical forms (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherol and alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocotrienol) that have varying levels of biological activity [ 1 ]. Alpha- (or α-) tocopherol is the only form that is recognized to meet human requirements.\nSerum concentrations of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) depend on the liver, which takes up the nutrient after the various forms are absorbed from the small intestine. The liver preferentially resecretes only alpha-tocopherol via the hepatic alpha-tocopherol transfer protein [ 1 ]; the liver metabolizes and excretes the other vitamin E forms [ 2 ]. As a result, blood and cellular concentrations of other forms of vitamin E are lower than those of alpha-tocopherol and have been the subjects of less research [ 3 , 4 ].\nAntioxidants protect cells from the damaging effects of free radicals, which are molecules that contain an unshared electron. Free radicals damage cells and might contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease and cancer [ 5 ]. Unshared electrons are highly energetic and react rapidly with oxygen to form reactive oxygen species (ROS). The body forms ROS endogenously when it converts food to energy, and antioxidants might protect cells from the damaging effects of ROS. The body is also exposed to free radicals from environmental exposures, such as cigarette smoke, air pollution, and ultraviolet radiation from the sun. ROS are part of signaling mechanisms among cells.\nVitamin E is a fat-soluble antioxidant that stops the production of ROS formed when fat undergoes oxidation. Scientists are investigating whether, by limiting free-radical production and possibly through other mechanisms, vitamin E might help prevent or delay the chronic diseases associated with free radicals.\nIn addition to its activities as an antioxidant, vitamin E is involved in immune function and, as shown primarily by in vitro studies of cells, cell signaling, regulation of gene expression, and other metabolic processes [ 1 ]. Alpha-tocopherol inhibits the activity of protein kinase C, an enzyme involved in cell proliferation and differentiation in smooth muscle cells, platelets, and monocytes [ 6 ]. Vitamin-E-replete endothelial cells lining the interior surface of blood vessels are better able to resist blood cell components adhering to this surface. Vitamin E also increases the expression of two enzymes that suppress arachidonic acid metabolism, thereby increasing the release of prostacyclin from the endothelium, which, in turn, dilates blood vessels and inhibits platelet aggregation [ 6 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for vitamin E and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the Institute of Medicine of The National Academies (formerly National Academy of Sciences) [ 6 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used to plan and assess nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and gender, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nThe FNB's vitamin E recommendations are for alpha-tocopherol alone, the only form maintained in plasma. The FNB based these recommendations primarily on serum levels of the nutrient that provide adequate protection in a test measuring the survival of erythrocytes when exposed to hydrogen peroxide, a free radical [ 6 ]. Acknowledging great uncertainties in these data, the FNB has called for research to identify other biomarkers for assessing vitamin E requirements.\nNaturally sourced vitamin E is called RRR -alpha-tocopherol (commonly labeled as d -alpha-tocopherol); the synthetically produced form is all rac -alpha-tocopherol (commonly labeled as dl -alpha-tocopherol).\nRDAs for vitamin E are provided in milligrams (mg) and are listed in Table 1. One mg vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) is equivalent to 1 mg RRR -alpha-tocopherol or 2 mg all rac -alpha-tocopherol. Because insufficient data are available to develop RDAs for infants, AIs were developed based on the amount of vitamin E consumed by healthy breastfed babies.\n*Adequate Intake (AI)\n",
    "Food": "Numerous foods provide vitamin E. Nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils are among the best sources of alpha-tocopherol, and significant amounts are available in green leafy vegetables and fortified cereals (see Table 2 for a more detailed list) [ 9 ]. Most vitamin E in American diets is in the form of gamma-tocopherol from soybean, canola, corn, and other vegetable oils and food products [ 4 ].\n*DV = Daily Value. FDA developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for vitamin E is 15 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 7 ]. One mg vitamin E = 1 mg RRR -alpha-tocopherol = 2 mg all rac -alpha-tocopherol. FDA does not require food labels to list vitamin E content unless vitamin E has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) FoodData Central website lists the nutrient content of many foods, including, in some cases, the amounts of alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherol. The USDA also provides a comprehensive list of foods containing vitamin E arranged by nutrient content and by food name .\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "Supplements of vitamin E typically provide only alpha-tocopherol, although mixed products containing other tocopherols and even tocotrienols are available. Naturally occurring alpha-tocopherol exists in one stereoisomeric form. In contrast, synthetically produced alpha-tocopherol contains equal amounts of its eight possible stereoisomers; serum and tissues maintain only four of these stereoisomers [ 6 ]. A given amount of synthetic alpha-tocopherol ( all rac -alpha-tocopherol; commonly labeled as DL or dl) is therefore only half as active as the same amount (by weight in mg) of the natural form ( RRR -alpha-tocopherol; commonly labeled as D or d).\nMost vitamin-E-only supplements provide ≥67 mg (100 IU of natural vitamin E) of the nutrient. These amounts are substantially higher than the RDAs.\nAlpha-tocopherol in dietary supplements and fortified foods is often esterified to prolong its shelf life while protecting its antioxidant properties. The body hydrolyzes and absorbs these esters (alpha-tocopheryl acetate and succinate) as efficiently as alpha-tocopherol [ 6 ].\n",

    "Cancer": "Antioxidant nutrients like vitamin E protect cell constituents from the damaging effects of free radicals that, if unchecked, might contribute to cancer development [ 9 ]. Vitamin E might also block the formation of carcinogenic nitrosamines formed in the stomach from nitrites in foods and protect against cancer by enhancing immune function [ 28 ]. Unfortunately, human trials and surveys that have attempted to associate vitamin E intake with cancer incidence have found that vitamin E is not beneficial in most cases.\nBoth the HOPE-TOO Trial and Women's Health Study evaluated whether vitamin E supplements might protect people from cancer. HOPE-TOO, which followed men and women ≥55 years of age with heart disease or diabetes for 7 years, found no significant differences in the number of new cancers or cancer deaths between individuals randomly assigned to take 400 IU/day of natural vitamin E (268 mg) or a placebo [ 22 ]. In the Women's Health Study, in which healthy women ≥45 years of age received either 600 IU of natural vitamin E (402 mg) every other day or a placebo for 10 years, the supplement did not reduce the risk of developing any form of cancer [ 25 ].\nSeveral studies have examined whether vitamin E intake and/or supplemental vitamin E affects the risk of developing prostate cancer. A prospective cohort study of >29,000 men found no association between dietary or supplemental vitamin E intake and prostate cancer risk [ 29 ]. However, among current smokers and men who had quit, vitamin E intakes of more than 400 IU/day (form not specified) were associated with a statistically significant 71% reduction in the risk of advanced prostate cancer. In a clinical trial involving 29,133 male smokers, men randomly assigned to take daily supplements of 111 IU of synthetic vitamin E (50 mg, as dl -alpha-tocopheryl acetate) for 5–8 years had 32% fewer prostate cancers compared to subjects who did not take the supplements [ 30 ]. Based in part on the promising results of this study, a large randomized clinical trial, called the SELECT trial, began in 2001 to determine whether 7–12 years of daily supplementation with 400 IU of synthetic vitamin E (180 mg, as dl -alpha-tocopheryl acetate), with or without selenium (200 mcg, as L-selenomethionine), reduced the number of new prostate cancers in 35,533 healthy men age 50 and older. The trial was discontinued in October 2008 when an analysis found that the supplements, taken alone or together for about 5.5 years, did not prevent prostate cancer [ 31 ]. Results from an additional 1.5 years of follow-up from this trial (during which the subjects no longer received vitamin E or selenium), showed that the men who had taken the vitamin E had a 17% increased risk of prostate cancer compared to men only taking placebos, a statistically significant difference [ 32 ]. The risk of developing prostate cancer was also slightly increased in subjects taking vitamin E plus selenium or selenium alone, but the differences were not statistically significant. No differences were found among groups in the incidence of lung or colorectal cancers or all cancers combined. Study staff members will continue to monitor participants' health for up to 5 more years. The National Cancer Institute website provides additional information on the SELECT trial .\nOne study of women in Iowa provides evidence that higher intakes of vitamin E from foods and supplements could decrease the risk of colon cancer, especially in women <65 years of age [ 33 ]. The overall relative risk for the highest quintile of intake (>35.7 IU/day, form not specified) compared to the lowest quintile (<5.7 IU/day, form not specified) was 0.32. However, prospective cohort studies of 87,998 women in the Nurses' Health Study and 47,344 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study failed to replicate these results [ 34 ]. Although some research links higher intakes of vitamin E with decreased incidence of breast cancer, an examination of the impact of dietary factors, including vitamin E, on the incidence of postmenopausal breast cancer in >18,000 women found no benefit from the vitamin [ 35 ].\nThe American Cancer Society conducted an epidemiologic study examining the association between use of vitamin C and vitamin E supplements and bladder cancer mortality. Of the almost one million adults followed between 1982 and 1998, adults who took supplemental vitamin E for 10 years or longer had a reduced risk of death from bladder cancer [ 36 ]; vitamin C supplementation provided no protection.\nEvidence to date is insufficient to support taking vitamin E to prevent cancer. In fact, daily use of large-dose vitamin E supplements (400 IU of synthetic vitamin E [180 mg]) may increase the risk of prostate cancer.\n",

    "International Units and Milligrams": "Vitamin E is listed on the new Nutrition Facts and Supplement Facts labels in mg [ 7 ]. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required manufacturers to use these new labels starting in January 2020, but companies with annual sales of less than $10 million were allowed to use the old labels that list vitamin E in International Units (IUs) until January 2021 [ 8 ]. Conversion rules are as follows:\nTo convert from mg to IU: 1 mg of alpha-tocopherol is equivalent to 1.49 IU of the natural form or 2.22 IU of the synthetic form. To convert from IU to mg: 1 IU of the natural form is equivalent to 0.67 mg of alpha-tocopherol. ​​​​​​​1 IU of the synthetic form is equivalent to 0.45 mg of alpha-tocopherol.\n1 mg of alpha-tocopherol is equivalent to 1.49 IU of the natural form or 2.22 IU of the synthetic form.\n1 IU of the natural form is equivalent to 0.67 mg of alpha-tocopherol. ​​​​​​​1 IU of the synthetic form is equivalent to 0.45 mg of alpha-tocopherol.\nFor example, 15 mg of natural alpha-tocopherol would equal 22.4 IU (15 mg x 1.49 IU/mg = 22.4 IU). The corresponding value for synthetic alpha-tocopherol would be 33.3 IU (15 mg x 2.22 IU/mg).\n",
    "Vitamin E Intakes and Status": "Three national surveys—the 2001–2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) [ 10 ], NHANES III (1988–1994) [ 10 ], and the Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (1994–1996) [ 11 ]—have found that the diets of most Americans provide less than the RDA levels of vitamin E. These intake estimates might be low, however, because the amounts and types of fat added during cooking are often unknown and not accounted for [ 6 ].\nThe FNB suggests that mean intakes of vitamin E among healthy adults are probably higher than the RDA but cautions that low-fat diets might provide insufficient amounts unless people make their food choices carefully by, for example, increasing their intakes of nuts, seeds, fruits, and vegetables [ 6 , 10 ]. The 1999–2000 NHANES found that 11.3% of adults took vitamin E supplements containing at least 400 IU [ 12 ].\n",
    "Vitamin E Deficiency": "Frank vitamin E deficiency is rare and overt deficiency symptoms have not been found in healthy people who obtain little vitamin E from their diets [ 6 ]. Premature babies of very low birth weight (<1,500 grams) might be deficient in vitamin E. Vitamin E supplementation in these infants might reduce the risk of some complications, such as those affecting the retina, but they can also increase the risk of infections [ 13 ].\nBecause the digestive tract requires fat to absorb vitamin E, people with fat-malabsorption disorders are more likely to become deficient than people without such disorders. Deficiency symptoms include peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, skeletal myopathy, retinopathy, and impairment of the immune response [ 6 , 14 ]. People with Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis, or an inability to secrete bile from the liver into the digestive tract, for example, often pass greasy stools or have chronic diarrhea; as a result, they sometimes require water-soluble forms of vitamin E, such as tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-1000 succinate [ 1 ].\nSome people with abetalipoproteinemia, a rare inherited disorder resulting in poor absorption of dietary fat, require enormous doses of supplemental vitamin E (approximately 100 mg/kg or 5–10 g/day) [ 1 ]. Vitamin E deficiency secondary to abetalipoproteinemia causes such problems as poor transmission of nerve impulses, muscle weakness, and retinal degeneration that leads to blindness [ 15 ]. Ataxia and vitamin E deficiency (AVED) is another rare, inherited disorder in which the liver's alpha-tocopherol transfer protein is defective or absent. People with AVED have such severe vitamin E deficiency that they develop nerve damage and lose the ability to walk unless they take large doses of supplemental vitamin E [ 16 ].\n",
    "Vitamin E and Health": "Many claims have been made about vitamin E's potential to promote health and prevent and treat disease. The mechanisms by which vitamin E might provide this protection include its function as an antioxidant and its roles in anti-inflammatory processes, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and immune enhancement.\nA primary barrier to characterizing the roles of vitamin E in health is the lack of validated biomarkers for vitamin E intake and status to help relate intakes to valid predictors of clinical outcomes [ 6 ]. This section focuses on four diseases and disorders in which vitamin E might be involved: heart disease, cancer, eye disorders, and cognitive decline.\n",
    "Coronary heart disease": "Evidence that vitamin E could help prevent or delay coronary heart disease (CHD) comes from several sources. In vitro studies have found that the nutrient inhibits oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, thought to be a crucial initiating step for atherosclerosis [ 6 ]. Vitamin E might also help prevent the formation of blood clots that could lead to a heart attack or venous thromboembolism [ 17 ].\nSeveral observational studies have associated lower rates of heart disease with higher vitamin E intakes. One study of approximately 90,000 nurses found that the incidence of heart disease was 30% to 40% lower in those with the highest intakes of vitamin E, primarily from supplements [ 18 ]. Among a group of 5,133 Finnish men and women followed for a mean of 14 years, higher vitamin E intakes from food were associated with decreased mortality from CHD [ 19 ].\nHowever, randomized clinical trials cast doubt on the efficacy of vitamin E supplements to prevent CHD [ 20 ]. For example, the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study, which followed almost 10,000 patients at high risk of heart attack or stroke for 4.5 years [ 21 ], found that participants taking 400 IU/day of natural vitamin E (268 mg) experienced no fewer cardiovascular events or hospitalizations for heart failure or chest pain than participants taking a placebo. In the HOPE-TOO follow-up study, almost 4,000 of the original participants continued to take vitamin E or placebo for an additional 2.5 years [ 22 ]. HOPE-TOO found that vitamin E provided no significant protection against heart attacks, strokes, unstable angina, or deaths from cardiovascular disease or other causes after 7 years of treatment. Participants taking vitamin E, however, were 13% more likely to experience, and 21% more likely to be hospitalized for, heart failure, a statistically significant but unexpected finding not reported in other large studies.\nThe HOPE and HOPE-TOO trials provide compelling evidence that moderately high doses of vitamin E supplements do not reduce the risk of serious cardiovascular events among men and women >50 years of age with established heart disease or diabetes [ 23 ]. These findings are supported by evidence from the Women's Angiographic Vitamin and Estrogen study, in which 423 postmenopausal women with some degree of coronary stenosis took supplements with 400 IU vitamin E (form not specified) and 500 mg vitamin C twice a day or placebo for >4 years [ 24 ]. Not only did the supplements provide no cardiovascular benefits, but all-cause mortality was significantly higher in the women taking the supplements.\nThe latest published clinical trial of vitamin E's effects on the heart and blood vessels of women included almost 40,000 healthy women ≥45 years of age who were randomly assigned to receive either 600 IU of natural vitamin E (402 mg) on alternate days or placebo and who were followed for an average of 10 years [ 25 ]. The investigators found no significant differences in rates of overall cardiovascular events (combined nonfatal heart attacks, strokes, and cardiovascular deaths) or all-cause mortality between the groups. However, the study did find two positive and significant results for women taking vitamin E: they had a 24% reduction in cardiovascular death rates, and those ≥65 years of age had a 26% decrease in nonfatal heart attack and a 49% decrease in cardiovascular death rates.\nThe most recent published clinical trial of vitamin E and men's cardiovascular health included almost 15,000 healthy physicians ≥50 years of age who were randomly assigned to receive 400 IU synthetic alpha-tocopherol (180 mg) every other day, 500 mg vitamin C daily, both vitamins, or placebo [ 26 ]. During a mean follow-up period of 8 years, intake of vitamin E (and/or vitamin C) had no effect on the incidence of major cardiovascular events, myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular morality. Furthermore, use of vitamin E was associated with a significantly increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke.\nIn general, clinical trials have not provided evidence that routine use of vitamin E supplements prevents cardiovascular disease or reduces its morbidity and mortality. However, participants in these studies have been largely middle-aged or elderly individuals with demonstrated heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. Some researchers have suggested that understanding the potential utility of vitamin E in preventing CHD might require longer studies in younger participants taking higher doses of the supplement [ 27 ]. Further research is needed to determine whether supplemental vitamin E has any protective value for younger, healthier people at no obvious risk of CHD.\n",
    "Eye disorders": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts are among the most common causes of significant vision loss in older people. Their etiologies are usually unknown, but the cumulative effects of oxidative stress have been postulated to play a role. If so, nutrients with antioxidant functions, such as vitamin E, could be used to prevent or treat these conditions.\nProspective cohort studies have found that people with relatively high dietary intakes of vitamin E (e.g., 20 mg/day [30 IU]) have an approximately 20% lower risk of developing AMD than people with low intakes (e.g., <10 mg/day [<15 IU]) [ 37 , 38 ]. However, two randomized controlled trials in which participants took supplements of vitamin E (500 IU/day [335 mg] d -alpha-tocopherol in one study [ 39 ] and 111 IU/day (50 mg) dl -alpha-tocopheryl acetate combined with 20 mg/day beta-carotene in the other [ 40 ]) or a placebo failed to show a protective effect for vitamin E on AMD. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), a large randomized clinical trial, found that participants at high risk of developing advanced AMD (i.e., those with intermediate AMD or those with advanced AMD in one eye) reduced their risk of developing advanced AMD by 25% by taking a daily supplement containing vitamin E (400 IU [180 mg] dl -alpha-tocopheryl acetate), beta-carotene (15 mg), vitamin C (500 mg), zinc (80 mg), and copper (2 mg) compared to participants taking a placebo over 5 years [ 41 ]. A follow-up AREDS2 study confirmed the value of this and similar supplement formulations in reducing the progression of AMD over a median follow-up period of 5 years [ 42 ].\nSeveral observational studies have revealed a potential relationship between vitamin E supplements and the risk of cataract formation. One prospective cohort study found that lens clarity was superior in participants who took vitamin E supplements and those with higher blood levels of the vitamin [ 43 ]. In another study, long-term use of vitamin E supplements was associated with slower progression of age-related lens opacification [ 44 ]. However, in the AREDS trial, the use of a vitamin E-containing (as dl -alpha-tocopheryl acetate) formulation had no apparent effect on the development or progression of cataracts over an average of 6.3 years [ 45 ]. The AREDS2 study, which also tested formulations containing 400 IU (180 mg) vitamin E, confirmed these findings [ 46 ].\nOverall, the available evidence is inconsistent with respect to whether vitamin E supplements, taken alone or in combination with other antioxidants, can reduce the risk of developing AMD or cataracts. However, the formulations of vitamin E, other antioxidants, zinc, and copper used in AREDS hold promise for slowing the progression of AMD in people at high risk of developing advanced AMD.\n",
    "Cognitive decline": "The brain has a high oxygen consumption rate and abundant polyunsaturated fatty acids in the neuronal cell membranes. Researchers hypothesize that if cumulative free-radical damage to neurons over time contributes to cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, then ingestion of sufficient or supplemental antioxidants (such as vitamin E) might provide some protection [ 47 ]. This hypothesis was supported by the results of a clinical trial in 341 patients with Alzheimer's disease of moderate severity who were randomly assigned to receive a placebo, vitamin E (2,000 IU/day dl -alpha-tocopherol), a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (selegiline), or vitamin E and selegiline [ 47 ]. Over 2 years, treatment with vitamin E and selegiline, separately or together, significantly delayed functional deterioration and the need for institutionalization compared to placebo. However, participants taking vitamin E experienced significantly more falls.\nVitamin E consumption from foods or supplements was associated with less cognitive decline over 3 years in a prospective cohort study of elderly, free-living individuals age 65–102 years [ 48 ]. However, a clinical trial in primarily healthy older women who were randomly assigned to receive 600 IU (402 mg) d -alpha-tocopherol every other day or a placebo for ≤4 years found that the supplements provided no apparent cognitive benefits [ 49 ]. Another trial in which 769 men and women with mild cognitive impairment were randomly assigned to receive 2,000 IU/day vitamin E (form not specified), a cholinesterase inhibitor (donepezil), or placebo found no significant differences in the progression rate of Alzheimer's disease between the vitamin E and placebo groups [ 50 ]\nIn summary, most research results do not support the use of vitamin E supplements by healthy or mildly impaired individuals to maintain cognitive performance or slow its decline with normal aging [ 51 ]. More research is needed to identify the role of vitamin E, if any, in the management of cognitive impairment [ 52 ].\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Vitamin E": "Research has not found any adverse effects from consuming vitamin E in food [ 6 ]. However, high doses of alpha-tocopherol supplements can cause hemorrhage and interrupt blood coagulation in animals, and in vitro data suggest that high doses inhibit platelet aggregation. Two clinical trials have found an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke in participants taking alpha-tocopherol; one trial included Finnish male smokers who consumed 50 mg/day for an average of 6 years [ 53 ] and the other trial involved a large group of male physicians in the United States who consumed 400 IU (180 mg) of synthetic vitamin E every other day for 8 years [ 26 ]. Because the majority of physicians in the latter study were also taking aspirin, this finding could indicate that vitamin E has a tendency to cause bleeding.\nThe FNB has established ULs for vitamin E based on the potential for hemorrhagic effects (see Table 3). The ULs apply to all forms of supplemental alpha-tocopherol, including the eight stereoisomers present in synthetic vitamin E. Doses of up to 1,000 mg/day (1,500 IU/day of the natural form or 1,100 IU/day of the synthetic form) in adults appear to be safe, although the data are limited and based on small groups of people taking up to 3,200 mg/day of alpha-tocopherol for only a few weeks or months. Long-term intakes above the UL increase the risk of adverse health effects [ 6 ]. Vitamin E ULs for infants have not been established.\nTwo meta-analyses of randomized trials have also raised questions about the safety of large doses of vitamin E, including doses lower than the UL. These meta-analyses linked supplementation to small but statistically significant increases in all-cause mortality. One analysis found an increased risk of death at doses of 400 IU/day (form not specified), although the risk began to increase at 150 IU [ 54 ]. In the other analysis of studies of antioxidant supplements for disease prevention, the highest quality trials revealed that vitamin E, administered singly (dose range 10 IU–5,000 IU/day; mean 569 IU [form not specified]) or combined with up to four other antioxidants, significantly increased mortality risk [ 55 ].\nThe implications of these analyses for the potential adverse effects of high-dose vitamin E supplements are unclear [ 56-59 ]. Participants in the studies included in these analyses were typically middle-aged or older and had chronic diseases or related risk factors. These participants often consumed other supplements in addition to vitamin E. Some of the studies analyzed took place in developing countries in which nutritional deficiencies are common. A review of the subset of studies in which vitamin E supplements were given to healthy individuals for the primary prevention of chronic disease found no convincing evidence that the supplements increased mortality [ 60 ].\nHowever, results from the recently published, large SELECT trial show that vitamin E supplements (400 IU/day [180 mg] as dl -alpha-tocopheryl acetate) may harm adult men in the general population by increasing their risk of prostate cancer [ 32 ]. Follow-up studies are assessing whether the cancer risk was associated with baseline blood levels of vitamin E and selenium prior to supplementation as well as whether changes in one or more genes might increase a man's risk of developing prostate cancer while taking vitamin E.\n",
    "Anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications": "Vitamin E can inhibit platelet aggregation and antagonize vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. As a result, taking large doses with anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, such as warfarin (Coumadin), can increase the risk of bleeding, especially in conjunction with low vitamin K intake. The amounts of supplemental vitamin E needed to produce clinically significant effects are unknown but probably exceed 400 IU/day [ 61 ].\n",
    "Simvastatin and niacin": "Some people take vitamin E supplements with other antioxidants, such as vitamin C, selenium, and beta-carotene. This collection of antioxidant ingredients blunted the rise in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, especially levels of HDL2, the most cardioprotective HDL component, among people treated with a combination of simvastatin (brand name Zocor) and niacin [ 62 , 63 ].\n",
    "Chemotherapy and radiotherapy": "Oncologists generally advise against the use of antioxidant supplements during cancer chemotherapy or radiotherapy because they might reduce the effectiveness of these therapies by inhibiting cellular oxidative damage in cancerous cells [ 64 , 65 ]. Although a systematic review of randomized controlled trials has called this concern into question [ 66 ], further research is needed to evaluate the potential risks and benefits of concurrent antioxidant supplementation with conventional therapies for cancer.\n",
    "Vitamin E and Healthful Diets": "The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. ​​​​​​​Vitamin E is found in green leafy vegetables, whole grains, fortified cereals, and vegetable oils. Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. ​​​​​​​Nuts are good sources of vitamin E. Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Limits alcoholic beverages.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet .\n",
    "Introduction": "Vitamin K, the generic name for a family of compounds with a common chemical structure of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in some foods and is available as a dietary supplement [ 1 ]. These compounds include phylloquinone (vitamin K1) and a series of menaquinones (vitamin K2) [ 2 ]. Menaquinones have unsaturated isoprenyl side chains and are designated as MK-4 through MK-13, based on the length of their side chain [ 1 , 2 ]. MK-4, MK-7, and MK-9 are the most well-studied menaquinones.\nPhylloquinone is present primarily in green leafy vegetables and is the main dietary form of vitamin K [ 3 ]. Menaquinones, which are predominantly of bacterial origin, are present in modest amounts in various animal-based and fermented foods [ 1 , 4 ]. Almost all menaquinones, in particular the long-chain menaquinones, are also produced by bacteria in the human gut [ 5 , 6 ]. MK-4 is unique in that it is produced by the body from phylloquinone via a conversion process that does not involve bacterial action [ 7 ].\nVitamin K functions as a coenzyme for vitamin K-dependent carboxylase, an enzyme required for the synthesis of proteins involved in hemostasis (blood clotting) and bone metabolism and other diverse physiological functions [ 3 , 5 ]. Prothrombin (clotting factor II) is a vitamin K-dependent protein in plasma that is directly involved in blood clotting. Warfarin (Coumadin) and some anticoagulants used primarily in Europe antagonize the activity of vitamin K and, in turn, prothrombin [ 8 ]. For this reason, individuals who are taking these anticoagulants need to maintain consistent vitamin K intakes.\nMatrix Gla-protein (MGP), a vitamin K-dependent protein present in vascular smooth muscle, bone, and cartilage, is the focus of considerable scientific research because it might help reduce abnormal calcification [ 9 ]. Osteocalcin is another vitamin K-dependent protein that is present in bone and may be involved in bone mineralization or turnover [ 5 ].\nLike dietary lipids and other fat-soluble vitamins, ingested vitamin K is incorporated into mixed micelles via the action of bile and pancreatic enzymes, and it is absorbed by enterocytes of the small intestine [ 10 ]. From there, vitamin K is incorporated into chylomicrons, secreted into the lymphatic capillaries, transported to the liver, and repackaged into very low-density lipoproteins [ 2 , 10 ]. Vitamin K is present in the liver and other body tissues, including the brain, heart, pancreas, and bone [ 2 , 3 , 11 ].\nIn the circulation, vitamin K is carried mainly in lipoproteins [ 2 ]. Compared to the other fat-soluble vitamins, very small amounts of vitamin K circulate in the blood. Vitamin K is rapidly metabolized and excreted. Based on phylloquinone measurements, the body retains only about 30% to 40% of an oral physiological dose, while about 20% is excreted in the urine and 40% to 50% in the feces via bile [ 2 , 11 ]. This rapid metabolism accounts for vitamin K's relatively low blood levels and tissue stores compared to those of the other fat-soluble vitamins [ 11 ].\nLittle is known about the absorption and transport of vitamin K produced by gut bacteria, but research indicates that substantial quantities of long-chain menaquinones are present in the large bowel [ 7 ]. Although the amount of vitamin K that the body obtains in this manner is unclear, experts believe that these menaquinones satisfy at least some of the body's requirement for vitamin K [ 6 , 7 ].\nIn most cases, vitamin K status is not routinely assessed, except in individuals who take anticoagulants or have bleeding disorders. The only clinically significant indicator of vitamin K status is prothrombin time (the time it takes for blood to clot), and ordinary changes in vitamin K intakes have rarely been shown to alter prothrombin time [ 5 ]. In healthy people, fasting concentrations of phylloquinone in plasma have been reported to range from 0.29 to 2.64 nmol/L [ 12 ]. However, it is not clear whether this measure can be used to quantitatively assess vitamin K status. People with plasma phylloquinone concentrations slightly below the normal range have no clinical indications of vitamin K deficiency, possibly because plasma phylloquinone concentrations do not measure the contribution of menaquinones from the diet and the large bowel [ 12 ]. No data on normal ranges of menaquinones are available [ 2 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for vitamin K and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies [ 3 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and gender, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\nInsufficient data were available to establish an EAR for vitamin K, so the FNB established AIs for all ages that are based on vitamin K intakes in healthy population groups [ 3 ]. Table 1 lists the current AIs for vitamin K in micrograms (mcg). The AIs for infants are based on the calculated mean vitamin K intake of healthy breastfed infants and the assumption that infants receive prophylactic vitamin K at birth as recommended by American and Canadian pediatric societies [ 3 ].\n",
    "Food": "Food sources of phylloquinone include vegetables, especially green leafy vegetables, vegetable oils, and some fruits. Meat, dairy foods, and eggs contain low levels of phylloquinone but modest amounts of menaquinones [ 4 ]. Natto (a traditional Japanese food made from fermented soybeans) has high amounts of menaquinones [ 1 , 13 ]. Other fermented foods, such as cheese, also contain menaquinones. However, the forms and amounts of vitamin K in these foods likely vary depending on the bacterial strains used to make the foods and their fermentation conditions [ 14 ]. Animals synthesize MK-4 from menadione (a synthetic form of vitamin K that can be used in poultry and swine feed) [ 15 ]. Thus, poultry and pork products contain MK-4 if menadione is added to the animal feed [ 1 , 4 , 14 ].\nThe most common sources of vitamin K in the U.S. diet are spinach; broccoli; iceberg lettuce; and fats and oils, particularly soybean and canola oil [ 5 , 7 ]. Few foods are fortified with vitamin K [ 5 ]; breakfast cereals are not typically fortified with vitamin K, although some meal replacement shakes and bars are.\nData on the bioavailability of different forms of vitamin K from food are very limited [ 1 ]. The absorption rate of phylloquinone in its free form is approximately 80%, but its absorption rate from foods is significantly lower [ 2 ]. Phylloquinone in plant foods is tightly bound to chloroplasts, so it is less bioavailable than that from oils or dietary supplements [ 1 ]. For example, the body absorbs only 4% to 17% as much phylloquinone from spinach as from a tablet [ 2 ]. Consuming vegetables at the same time as some fat improves phylloquinone absorption from the vegetables, but the amount absorbed is still lower than that from oils. Limited research suggests that long-chain MKs may have higher absorption rates than phylloquinone from green vegetables [ 7 ].\nSeveral food sources of vitamin K are listed in Table 2. All values in this table are for phylloquinone content, except when otherwise indicated, because food composition data for menaquinones are limited [ 1 ].\n*DV = Daily Value. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for vitamin K is 120 mcg for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 17 ]. FDA does not require food labels to list vitamin K content unless vitamin K has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) FoodData Central [ 16 ] lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides comprehensive lists of foods containing vitamin K (phylloquinone) arranged by nutrient content and by food name and of foods containing vitamin K (MK-4) arranged by nutrient content and food name .\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "Vitamin K is present in most multivitamin/mineral supplements, typically at values less than 75% of the DV [ 18 ]. It is also available in dietary supplements containing only vitamin K or vitamin K combined with a few other nutrients, frequently calcium, magnesium, and/or vitamin D. These supplements tend to have a wider range of vitamin K doses than multivitamin/mineral supplements, with some providing 4,050 mcg (5,063% of the DV) or another very high amount [ 18 ].\nSeveral forms of vitamin K are used in dietary supplements, including vitamin K1 as phylloquinone or phytonadione (a synthetic form of vitamin K1) and vitamin K2 as MK-4 or MK-7 [ 18 ]. Few data are available on the relative bioavailability of the various forms of vitamin K supplements. One study found that both phytonadione and MK-7 supplements are well absorbed, but MK-7 has a longer half-life [ 19 ].\nMenadione, which is sometimes called vitamin K3, is another synthetic form of vitamin K. It was shown to damage hepatic cells in laboratory studies conducted during the 1980s and 1990s, so it is no longer used in dietary supplements or fortified foods [ 3 ].\n",

    "Coronary heart disease": "Vascular calcification is one of the risk factors for coronary heart disease because it reduces aortic and arterial elasticity [ 40 ]. MGP is a vitamin K-dependent protein that may play a role in the prevention of vascular calcification [ 5 , 41 ]. Although the full biological function of MGP is unclear, a hypothesis based on animal data suggests that inadequate vitamin K status leads to undercarboxylated MGP, which could increase vascular calcification and the risk of coronary heart disease. These findings might be particularly relevant for patients with chronic kidney disease because their rates of vascular calcification are much higher than those of the general population [ 9 ].\nIn an observational study conducted in the Netherlands in 564 postmenopausal women, dietary menaquinone (but not phylloquinone) intake was inversely associated with coronary calcification [ 42 ]. Menaquinone intake was also inversely associated with severe aortic calcification in a prospective, population-based cohort study involving 4,807 men and women age 55 years and older from the Netherlands [ 41 ]. Participants in this study who had dietary menaquinone intakes in the mid tertile (21.6–32.7 mcg/day) and upper tertile (>32.7 mcg/day) also had a 27% and 57% lower risk of coronary heart disease mortality, respectively, than those in the lower tertile of intake (<21.6 mcg/day). Phylloquinone intake had no effect on any outcome.\nDespite these data, few trials have investigated the effects of vitamin K supplementation on arterial calcification or coronary heart disease risk. One randomized, double-blind clinical trial examined the effect of phylloquinone supplementation in 388 healthy men and postmenopausal women age 60–80 years [ 43 ]. Participants received either a multivitamin (containing B-vitamins, vitamin C, and vitamin E) plus 500 International Units (IU) vitamin D3, 600 mg calcium, and 500 mcg phylloquinone daily (treatment) or a multivitamin plus calcium and vitamin D3 only (control) for 3 years. There was no significant difference in coronary artery calcification between the treatment and control groups. However, among the 295 participants who adhered to the supplementation protocol, those in the treatment group had significantly less coronary artery calcification progression than those in the control group. Furthermore, among those with coronary artery calcification at baseline, phylloquinone treatment reduced calcification progression by 6% compared to the control group. Based on these findings, the authors did not make any clinical recommendations, and they called for larger studies in other populations.\nAt this time, the role of the different forms of vitamin K on arterial calcification and the risk of coronary heart disease is unclear, but it continues to be an active area of research in the general population and in patients with chronic kidney disease [ 5 , 9 , 44 ].\n",

    "Vitamin K Intakes and Status": "Most U.S. diets contain an adequate amount of vitamin K [ 7 ]. Data from the 2011–2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) show that among children and teens age 2–19 years, the average daily vitamin K intake from foods is 66 mcg [ 20 ]. In adults age 20 and older, the average daily vitamin K intake from foods is 122 mcg for women and 138 mcg for men. When both foods and supplements are considered, the average daily vitamin K intake increases to 164 mcg for women and 182 mcg for men.\nSome analyses of NHANES datasets from 2003–2006 and 2007–2010 raised concerns about average vitamin K intakes because only about one-third of the U.S. population had a vitamin K intake above the AI [ 21 , 22 ]. The significance of these findings is unclear because the AI is only an estimate of need, especially for vitamins (like vitamin K) that are also synthesized endogenously. Moreover, reports of vitamin K deficiency in adults are very rare [ 3 , 7 ]. Finally, food composition databases provide information primarily on phylloquinone; menaquinones—either dietary or from bacterial production in the gut—likely also contribute to vitamin K status [ 1 , 6 , 7 ].\n",
    "Vitamin K Deficiency": "Vitamin K deficiency is only considered clinically relevant when prothrombin time increases significantly due to a decrease in the prothrombin activity of blood [ 3 , 7 ]. Thus, bleeding and hemorrhage are the classic signs of vitamin K deficiency, although these effects occur only in severe cases. Because vitamin K is required for the carboxylation of osteocalcin in bone, vitamin K deficiency could also reduce bone mineralization and contribute to osteoporosis [ 23 ].\nVitamin K deficiency can occur during the first few weeks of infancy due to low placental transfer of phylloquinone, low clotting factor levels, and low vitamin K content of breast milk [ 7 ]. Clinically significant vitamin K deficiency in adults is very rare and is usually limited to people with malabsorption disorders or those taking drugs that interfere with vitamin K metabolism [ 3 , 7 ]. In healthy people consuming a varied diet, achieving a vitamin K intake low enough to alter standard clinical measures of blood coagulation is almost impossible [ 3 ].\n",
    "Groups at Risk of Vitamin K Inadequacy": "The following groups are among those most likely to have inadequate vitamin K status.\n",
    "Newborns not treated with vitamin K at birth": "Vitamin K transport across the placenta is poor, increasing the risk of vitamin K deficiency in newborn babies [ 3 ]. During the first few weeks of life, vitamin K deficiency can cause vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB), a condition formerly known as classic hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. VKDB is associated with bleeding in the umbilicus, gastrointestinal tract, skin, nose, or other sites [ 7 , 24 , 25 ]. VKDB is known as early VKDB when it occurs in the first week of life. Late VKDB occurs at age 2–12 weeks, especially in exclusively breastfed infants due to the low vitamin K content of breast milk or in infants with malabsorption problems (such as cholestatic jaundice or cystic fibrosis) [ 7 ]. VKDB, especially late VKDB, can also be manifested as sudden intracranial bleeding, which has a high mortality rate [ 7 , 25 ]. To prevent VKDB, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the administration of a single, intramuscular dose of 0.5 to 1 milligram (mg) vitamin K1 at birth [ 24 ].\n",
    "People with malabsorption disorders": "People with malabsorption syndromes and other gastrointestinal disorders, such as cystic fibrosis, celiac disease, ulcerative colitis, and short bowel syndrome, might not absorb vitamin K properly [ 3 , 5 , 23 ]. Vitamin K status can also be low in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery, although clinical signs may not be present [ 26 ]. These individuals might need monitoring of vitamin K status and, in some cases, vitamin K supplementation.\n",
    "Vitamin K and Health": "This section focuses on two conditions in which vitamin K might play a role: osteoporosis and coronary heart disease.\n",
    "Osteoporosis": "Osteoporosis, a disorder characterized by porous and fragile bones, is a serious public health problem that affects more than 10 million U.S. adults, 80% of whom are women. Consuming adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D, especially throughout childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood, is important to maximize bone mass and reduce the risk of osteoporosis [ 27 ]. The effect of vitamin K intakes and status on bone health and osteoporosis has been a focus of scientific research.\nVitamin K is a cofactor for the gamma-carboxylation of many proteins, including osteocalcin, one of the main proteins in bone [ 28 ]. Some research indicates that high serum levels of undercarboxylated osteocalcin are associated with lower bone mineral density [ 5 , 28 ]. Some, but not all, studies also link higher vitamin K intakes with higher bone mineral density and/or lower hip fracture incidence [ 29-34 ].\nAlthough vitamin K is involved in the carboxylation of osteocalcin, it is unclear whether supplementation with any form of vitamin K reduces the risk of osteoporosis. In 2006, Cockayne and colleagues conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that examined the effects of vitamin K supplementation on bone mineral density and bone fracture [ 35 ]. Most of the trials were conducted in Japan and involved postmenopausal women; trial duration ranged from 6 to 36 months. Thirteen trials were included in the systematic review, and 12 showed that supplementation with either phytonadione or MK-4 improved bone mineral density. Seven of the 13 trials also had fracture data that were combined in a meta-analysis. All of these trials used MK-4 at either 15 mg/day (1 trial) or 45 mg/day (6 trials). MK-4 supplementation significantly reduced rates of hip fractures, vertebral fractures, and all nonvertebral fractures.\nA subsequent clinical trial found that MK-7 supplementation (180 mcg/day for 3 years) improved bone strength and decreased the loss in vertebral height in the lower thoracic region of the vertebrae in postmenopausal women [ 36 ]. Other randomized clinical trials since the 2006 review by Cockayne et al. have found that vitamin K supplementation has no effect on bone mineral density in elderly men or women [ 37 , 38 ]. In one of these studies, 381 postmenopausal women received either 1 mg phylloquinone, 45 mg MK-4, or placebo daily for 12 months [ 38 ]. All participants also received daily supplements containing 630 mg calcium and 400 IU vitamin D3. At the end of the study, participants receiving either phylloquinone or MK-4 had significantly lower levels of undercarboxylated osteocalcin compared to those receiving placebo. However, there were no significant differences in bone mineral density of the lumbar spine or proximal femur among any of the treatment groups. The authors noted the importance of considering the effect of vitamin D on bone health when comparing the results of vitamin K supplementation studies, especially if both vitamin K and vitamin D (and/or calcium) are administered to the treatment group but not the placebo group [ 38 ]. The administration of vitamin D and/or calcium along with vitamin K could partly explain why some studies have found that vitamin K supplementation improves bone health while others have not.\nIn Japan and other parts of Asia, a pharmacological dose of MK-4 (45 mg) is used as a treatment for osteoporosis [ 5 ]. The European Food Safety Authority has approved a health claim for vitamin K, noting that \"a cause and effect relationship has been established between the dietary intake of vitamin K and the maintenance of normal bone\" [ 39 ]. FDA has not authorized a health claim for vitamin K in the United States.\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Vitamin K": "The FNB did not establish ULs for vitamin K because of its low potential for toxicity [ 3 ]. In its report, the FNB stated that \"no adverse effects associated with vitamin K consumption from food or supplements have been reported in humans or animals.\"\n",
    "Warfarin (Coumadin) and similar anticoagulants": "Vitamin K can have a serious and potentially dangerous interaction with anticoagulants such as warfarin (Coumadin) as well as phenprocoumon, acenocoumarol, and tioclomarol, which are commonly used in some European countries [ 7 , 8 ]. These drugs antagonize the activity of vitamin K, leading to the depletion of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. People taking warfarin and similar anticoagulants need to maintain a consistent intake of vitamin K from food and supplements because sudden changes in vitamin K intakes can increase or decrease the anticoagulant effect [ 45 ].\n",
    "Antibiotics": "Antibiotics can destroy vitamin K-producing bacteria in the gut, potentially decreasing vitamin K status. This effect might be more pronounced with cephalosporin antibiotics, such as cefoperazone (Cefobid), because these antibiotics might also inhibit the action of vitamin K in the body [ 6 , 46 ]. Vitamin K supplements are usually not needed unless antibiotic use is prolonged (beyond several weeks) and accompanied by poor vitamin K intake [ 46 ].\n",
    "Bile acid sequestrants": "Bile acid sequestrants, such as cholestyramine (Questran) and colestipol (Colestid), are used to reduce cholesterol levels by preventing reabsorption of bile acids. They can also reduce the absorption of vitamin K and other fat-soluble vitamins, although the clinical significance of this effect is not clear [ 46 , 47 ]. Vitamin K status should be monitored in people taking these medications, especially when the drugs are used for many years [ 47 ].\n",
    "Vitamin K and Healthful Diets": "The federal government's 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA's MyPlate.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Many vegetables are excellent sources of vitamin K, and some fruits and fruit juices contain vitamin K. Cheese contains vitamin K.

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet .\n",
    "Introduction": "Zinc, an essential mineral, is naturally present in some foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. Zinc is also found in some cold lozenges, over-the-counter drugs sold as cold remedies, and some denture adhesive creams.\nZinc is involved in many aspects of cellular metabolism. It is required for the catalytic activity of hundreds of enzymes, and it plays a role in enhancing immune function, protein and DNA synthesis, wound healing, and cell signaling and division [ 1-4 ]. Zinc also supports healthy growth and development during pregnancy, infancy, childhood, and adolescence and is involved in the sense of taste [ 2 , 3 , 5 ].\nThe total amount of zinc in the body is approximately 1.5 g in women and 2.5 g in men [ 2 ]. Most of this zinc is stored in skeletal muscle and bone [ 1-3 ].\nThe processes that maintain zinc homeostasis are absorption of zinc from the diet, excretion into the gastrointestinal tract, and reabsorption in the gastrointestinal lumen [ 2 , 3 ]. In general, as zinc intakes rise, the amount of zinc absorbed also increases, but its fractional absorption drops [ 2 , 3 ].\nSerum or plasma zinc levels are typically used in clinical practice to assess zinc status. In healthy people, the amount of zinc in serum or plasma is 80 to 120 mcg/dL (12 to 18 mcmol/L) [ 2 ]. Serum zinc levels below 70 mcg/dL in women and 74 mcg/dL in men indicate inadequate zinc status. However, both serum and plasma measures have important limitations. Zinc concentrations in serum are associated with the patient’s sex and age as well as the time of the blood draw (morning vs. evening) and do not always correlate with dietary or supplemental zinc intakes [ 6 ]. Zinc levels also fluctuate in response to other factors, including infections, changes in steroid hormones, and muscle catabolism during weight loss or illness [ 1 , 3 ]. Clinicians consider risk factors (such as inadequate caloric intake, chronic alcohol use, and malabsorptive digestive diseases) and signs of zinc deficiency (such as impaired growth in infants and children) when they assess a patient’s zinc status [ 1 ].\n",
    "Recommended Intakes": "Intake recommendations for zinc and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [ 1 ]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\n*Adequate Intake (AI), equivalent to the mean intake of zinc in healthy, breastfed infants.\n",
    "Food": "The richest food sources of zinc include meat, fish, and seafood [ 3 ]. Oysters contain more zinc per serving than any other food, but beef contributes 20% of zinc intakes from food in the United States because it is commonly consumed [ 7 ]. Eggs and dairy products also contain zinc [ 3 ]. Beans, nuts, and whole grains contain zinc, but the bioavailability of zinc from these foods is lower than that from animal foods because these foods contain phytates. Phytates, the storage form of phosphorus in plants, bind some minerals such as zinc in the intestine and form an insoluble complex that inhibits zinc absorption [ 1-3 , 8 ]. Fruits and vegetables contain very little zinc.\nBreakfast cereals, which are often fortified with zinc, are a major source of zinc in the U.S. diet [ 3 ]. In U.S. children and adolescents, 12.1% to 18.4% of daily zinc intakes come from enriched and fortified foods [ 9 ].\nThe amount of zinc absorbed from food ranges from 5% to more than 50%, depending on the amount of plant-based foods (and thus of phytate) in the diet [ 3 ]. The absorption of zinc from mixed meals or diets containing a combination of animal-based and plant-based foods is lower than from diets or meals containing animal-based foods only [ 10 ].\nTable 2 lists a variety of foods and their zinc content per serving [ 11 ].\n*DV = Daily Value. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for zinc is 11 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older [ 12 ]. FDA does not require food labels to list zinc content unless zinc has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA's) FoodData Central lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing zinc arranged by nutrient content and by food name .\n",
    "Dietary supplements": "Zinc is available in supplements containing only zinc; supplements containing zinc in combination with other ingredients; and in many multivitamin/mineral products [ 13 ]. Supplements can contain any of a variety of forms of zinc, including zinc sulfate, zinc acetate, and zinc gluconate [ 14 ]. The Supplement Facts panel on a dietary supplement label declares the amount of elemental zinc in the product, not the weight of the entire zinc-containing compound.\nAbsorption of zinc from supplements containing zinc citrate or zinc gluconate is similar, at approximately 61% in young adults; the absorption from supplements containing zinc oxide is 50% [ 15 ]. Taking supplements containing 25 mg elemental iron or more at the same time as zinc supplements can reduce zinc absorption and plasma zinc concentrations [ 16-19 ]. However, the iron added to enriched or fortified foods does not interfere with zinc absorption.\n",

    "Age-related macular degeneration": "AMD is the leading cause of significant vision loss in older people [ 81 ]. The human retina has a high zinc concentration, and research has shown that supplements containing both zinc and antioxidants might delay the progression of AMD and vision loss, possibly by preventing cellular damage in the retina [ 3 , 82 , 83 ].\nObservational evidence suggests a link between higher zinc intakes and a lower risk of AMD. In a population-based cohort study in the Netherlands that included 4,170 adults age 55 or older, dietary zinc intake was inversely associated with the risk of AMD over a mean follow-up period of 8 years [ 84 ]. Similarly, a study of 2,464 adults age 49 or older in Australia found that at 5-year and 10-year follow-up, participants with intakes of zinc from food and supplements in the top decile (at least 15.8 mg/day) had a 44% lower risk of any AMD and a 46% lower risk of early AMD than participants in all other deciles [ 85 ].\nClinical trial evidence has confirmed the benefits of zinc supplementation, in combination with certain antioxidants, for slowing the progression of AMD. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) was a clinical trial in 4,757 participants age 50 to 80 years with a high risk of advanced AMD (i.e., they had intermediate AMD or advanced AMD in one eye and good vision in the other eye) [ 83 ]. AREDS found that participants who took a supplement each day containing 80 mg zinc in the form of zinc oxide, 15 mg (7,500 mcg retinol activity equivalent [RAE]) beta-carotene, 180 mg (400 International Units [IU]) vitamin E in the form of dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate, 500 mg vitamin C, and 2 mg copper for 5 years had a 25% lower risk of advanced AMD than those taking a placebo.\nThe follow-up AREDS2 study confirmed the value of the AREDS supplement in reducing the progression of AMD in 4,203 participants over a median follow-up period of 5 years [ 86 ]. AREDS2 also showed that a formulation providing 25 mg zinc (about one-third the amount in the original formulation) provided the same protective effect against advanced AMD. However, because AREDS2 had fewer participants than the original AREDS study, and fewer than half took the formula containing less zinc, the researchers viewed this finding as preliminary. The National Eye Institute recommends use of an AREDS formulation providing 80 mg zinc [ 87 , 88 ].\nIndividuals who have or are developing AMD should talk to their health care provider about their zinc intakes and the supplement formulations used in the AREDS studies.\n",

    "The common cold": "Researchers have hypothesized that zinc could reduce the severity and duration of cold signs and symptoms by directly inhibiting rhinovirus binding and replication in the nasal mucosa and suppressing inflammation [ 55 , 56 ]. In studies examining the effects of zinc supplements on the common cold, zinc is usually administered in a lozenge or syrup that temporarily sticks to the mouth and throat, placing the zinc in contact with the rhinovirus in those areas.\nThe results from clinical trials that have examined the effects of zinc supplements on the common cold have been inconsistent. Overall, however, supplemental zinc in lozenge or syrup form appears to reduce the duration, but not the severity, of signs and symptoms of the common cold when taken shortly after a person develops a cold [ 57-60 ].\nIn one clinical trial, 50 adults took a zinc acetate lozenge (13.3 mg zinc) or placebo every 2–3 wakeful hours within 24 hours of developing the common cold for as long as they had cold symptoms. In comparison with placebo, the zinc lozenges reduced the duration of colds by 3 days and the severity of cold symptoms (cough, nasal discharge, and muscle aches) [ 61 ]. In another clinical trial, 273 adults with experimentally induced colds were randomly assigned to take zinc gluconate (13.3 mg zinc) or zinc acetate (5.0 mg or 11.5 mg) lozenges every 2 to 3 hours while awake, for a total of six lozenges per day, or placebo, for up to 14 days [ 62 ]. Duration of illness was 1 day less with the zinc gluconate supplements than with the placebo, but the lozenges had no effect on symptom severity. Furthermore, the 5.0 and 11.5 mg zinc acetate lozenges had no effect on either cold duration or severity. In a second trial described in the same report, neither zinc gluconate nor zinc acetate lozenges affected the duration or severity of cold symptoms in comparison with placebo in 281 adults with colds [ 62 ].\nA 2021 systematic review and meta-analysis included 28 randomized controlled trials (including the three described above) with a total of 5,446 participants (mostly adults younger than 65 years) who had a community-acquired viral respiratory tract infection or were inoculated with a rhinovirus [ 57 ]. Most trials provided zinc in the form of zinc acetate or gluconate lozenges at total daily doses of 45 mg to 300 mg for up to 2 weeks, but some trials used nasal sprays or gels. In participants who used products containing zinc, symptoms resolved an average of 2 days earlier than in those who received a placebo. However, average daily symptom severity did not differ between those who were and were not treated with zinc. The author of an earlier systematic review concluded that the use of zinc lozenges at doses of over 75 mg/day reduced the duration of the common cold, whereas lower doses did not [ 59 ].\nAdditional research is needed to determine the optimal dosage, formulation, and administration schedule before a general recommendation can be made regarding the use of lozenges, gels, and sprays containing zinc to reduce the severity and duration of symptoms of the common cold [ 58-60 ].\n",

    "Type 2 diabetes": "Zinc concentrations are often low in people with T2D [ 2 , 3 ]. Researchers therefore hypothesize that zinc depletion might play a role in diabetes progression.\nSeveral observational studies have found an association between zinc intakes and risk of T2D. In a systematic review and meta-analysis that included 16 observational studies conducted in the United States, Australia, Sweden, India, and Japan with a total of 146,027 men and women age 18 to 84 years, the risk of T2D was 13% lower in participants with the highest zinc intakes than in those with the lowest intakes [ 89 ]. When the researchers analyzed the influence of area of residence on the results, the associations between zinc intakes and T2D risk were significant only for studies conducted in rural areas and not those conducted in urban areas.\nClinical trials have assessed the utility of zinc supplements to reduce the risk of T2D or to manage its complications. In a 2015 Cochrane Review of the clinical trial evidence on zinc supplementation for T2D prevention, only three trials with a total of 128 participants met the inclusion criteria [ 90 ]. These studies administered 30 mg to 100 mg zinc (in the form of zinc sulfate or zinc amino chelate) per day for 4 to 12 weeks, but the quality of these studies could not be assessed because of the lack of relevant information in the study reports. The Cochrane Review authors concluded that evidence is lacking on which to base conclusions about the use of zinc supplementation to prevent T2D.\nHowever, studies published since the Cochrane Review have had more positive findings. A systematic review and meta-analysis included nine placebo-controlled trials assessing the effects of zinc supplementation (7 mg/day to 150 mg/day) for 6 to 52 weeks on lipid profiles in a total of 424 people with T2D [ 91 ]. The supplements had beneficial effects on serum levels of triglycerides and total cholesterol but not on serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels.\nA second systematic review and meta-analysis compared the effects of low-dose zinc supplements (less than 25 mg/day) with those of high-dose supplements (25 to 75 mg/day) on risk factors for T2D and cardiovascular disease in 27 clinical trials (including two from the 2015 Cochrane Review) [ 92 ]. Zinc supplements were administered for 4 weeks to 12 months (mean 11 weeks) to a total of 1,042 participants age 6 to 106 years (but most studies included adults age 20 to 70 years) and placebo to 974 participants. Although low-dose and high-dose zinc supplements had beneficial effects on several outcomes assessed, low doses of zinc and longer administration improved a larger number of risk factors. For example, studies that administered zinc supplements for less than 12 weeks had beneficial effects on fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, and triglyceride levels, whereas studies that administered the supplements for longer had positive effects on fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, triglyceride, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol levels. Sensitivity analyses showed no significant effect of zinc dosage on these outcomes.\nA third systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effects of zinc supplements on T2D prevention and management in 32 trials that administered zinc supplements (4 to 240 mg/day zinc, mean 35 mg/day) or placebo for 1 to 12 months to a total of 1,700 adults age 18 and older with T2D (except that one included study was in children age 6 to 10 years) [ 93 ]. The supplements reduced fasting glucose, 2-hour postprandial glucose, fasting insulin, insulin resistance, glycated hemoglobin, and C-reactive protein levels. Glycemic indicators did not vary by zinc dosage (less than 30 mg/day or at least 30 mg/day) or duration of supplementation (1 month or more than 1 month).\nResearch has also explored the potential benefits of zinc supplementation in people with gestational diabetes. A systematic review and meta-analysis of five placebo-controlled trials that included 263 people with gestational diabetes evaluated the effects of zinc supplementation (4 to 30 mg/day zinc with or without vitamin E, magnesium, calcium, vitamin D, or a combination) on metabolic status [ 94 ]. The supplements had beneficial effects on fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance, but did not affect LDL or total cholesterol levels. However, because this analysis included studies that administered zinc in combination with other nutrients, the potential contribution of zinc by itself cannot be assessed.\nUp to one quarter of people with T2D develop diabetic foot ulcers, which can result in amputation [ 95 ]. A Cochrane Review of nutritional interventions to treat diabetic foot ulcers included one trial in 60 participants of 50 mg zinc (in the form of zinc sulfate) or placebo for 12 weeks [ 96 ]. The authors concluded that whether zinc supplements affect diabetic foot ulcers over time is uncertain.\nOverall, the evidence to date is insufficient to support any conclusions about the impact of zinc supplementation on the prevalence or severity of T2D, gestational diabetes, or diabetic foot ulcers.\n",

    "Other sources": "Products containing zinc include some labeled as homeopathic medications as well as nasal sprays that are sold over the counter to treat or prevent the common cold, manage flu symptoms, and support immune system health.\nSome denture adhesive creams contain 17–34 mg/g zinc to enhance their adhesive properties [ 20 ]. Use as directed, resulting in intakes of 0.5–1.5 g zinc from these products per day, is not a concern. However, chronic, excessive use can lead to zinc toxicity, which can cause copper deficiency and neurologic diseases. Such toxicity has been reported in individuals who use at least one tube containing a total of 2.4 g or more denture cream each week for several years [ 21-23 ]. Many denture creams have been reformulated to omit zinc.\n",
    "Zinc Intakes and Status": "Most people in the United States consume adequate amounts of zinc, but people in certain age groups, especially older adults, might have marginal intakes. The average daily zinc intake from foods is 7.6–9.7 mg/day in children age 2–11 years, 10.1 mg/day in children and teens age 12–19 years, 13 mg/day in men older than 19, and 9.2 mg/day in women [ 24 ]. The average daily zinc intake from foods and supplements is 8.4–10.4 mg/day in children age 2–11 years, 10.7 mg/day in children and teens age 12–19 years, 16.4 mg/day in men, and 12.6 mg/day in women. In pregnant women age 20–40 years, the mean zinc intake is 12.4 mg/day from foods alone and 22.7 mg/day from foods and supplements [ 25 ].\nLess than 1% of U.S. children age 2 to 8 years have zinc intakes from foods and supplements that are lower than the EAR. Among boys age 14 to 18 years, 1% have intakes below the EAR [ 9 ]. However, the proportion is much higher, 20.9%, in girls in this age group. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2005 to 2016 show that among U.S. adults age 19 years and older, 15% have zinc intakes below the EAR [ 26 ].\nIn the United States, 3.8% of children younger than 10, 8.6% of males age 10 and older, and 8.2% of females have serum zinc concentrations below the serum zinc cutoff for sufficiency for their age and sex according to an analysis of 2011–2014 NHANES data [ 6 , 8 ]. The investigators used cutoffs developed by the Biomarkers of Nutrition for Development Zinc Expert Panel on the basis of a statistical definition: 57–65 mcg/dL for children younger than 10, 69–70 mcg/dL for females age 10 and older, and 61–74 mcg/dL for males age 10 and older [ 8 ].\nZinc deficiency based on serum or plasma concentrations is much more common in low-income and middle-income countries [ 27 ]. According to an estimate based on analyses of zinc and phytate available in national food supplies and the prevalence of stunting, approximately 17% of the world’s population is likely to have zinc deficiency [ 28 ].\n",
    "Zinc Deficiency": "Because zinc has many functions throughout the body, zinc deficiency affects many different tissues and organs [ 29 ]. Zinc deficiency can affect, for example, skin; bones; and the digestive, reproductive, central nervous, and immune systems [ 29 ].\nThe manifestations of zinc deficiency vary by age [ 29 ]. In infants and children, diarrhea is a common sign. In older children, alopecia, delayed growth, and frequent infections become more prevalent. In both infants and children, zinc deficiency can impair growth and lead to a loss of appetite and reproductive problems when they reach adulthood [ 2 , 3 , 27 , 30 ]. In populations with low intakes of absorbable zinc (e.g., from meat and fish), including many low-income and middle-income countries, zinc deficiency affects the health of pregnant women and their infants by increasing the risk of child morbidity (including premature birth and low birthweight) and mortality, maternal morbidity, and adverse birth outcomes [ 27 ]. In addition, zinc deficiency can interfere with the senses of taste and smell [ 5 ]. Zinc deficiency in older adults can cause delays in wound healing and changes in cognitive and psychological function [ 29 ].\n",
    "Groups at Risk of Zinc Inadequacy": "The following groups are among those most likely to have inadequate zinc status.\n",
    "People with gastrointestinal disorders or who have had bariatric surgery": "Zinc inadequacy is common in people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD, which includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease) or bariatric surgery involving resection of the gastrointestinal tract because of poor dietary intakes, decreased absorption, or increased urinary excretion as a result of inflammation [ 31 , 32 ]. Approximately 15% to 40% of people with IBD have zinc deficiency during active disease states and while in remission [ 31 , 32 ]. In patients with zinc deficiency, the risk of IBD-related symptoms (including anemia, hemorrhage, and abdominal or perianal fistula) increases, and these patients are more likely to need hospitalization or surgery. Zinc supplementation might reduce these risks [ 31 ].\nApproximately 50% of people with newly diagnosed celiac disease have a high risk of zinc inadequacy or deficiency; potential contributors to this risk might include zinc malabsorption and mucosal inflammation [ 33 , 34 ]. These deficiencies sometimes persist even when people with celiac disease avoid foods containing gluten [ 34 ].\n",
    "Vegetarians (especially vegans)": "The bioavailability of zinc from vegetarian diets is lower than from nonvegetarian diets because vegetarians typically eat large amounts of legumes and whole grains, which contain phytates that bind zinc and inhibit its absorption [ 2 ]. In addition, meat is high in bioavailable zinc [ 35 ]. As a result, vegetarians and vegans usually have lower dietary intakes of zinc and lower serum zinc levels than nonvegetarians [ 36 ].\nVegetarians and vegans might benefit from using certain food preparation techniques that reduce the binding of zinc by phytates and increase its bioavailability, such as soaking beans, grains, and seeds in water for several hours before cooking them [ 37 ]. In addition, organic acids in fermented foods might increase zinc absorption [ 37 ]. Vegetarians and vegans might also benefit from zinc supplements [ 38 ].\n",
    "Women who are pregnant or lactating": "During pregnancy, the amount of zinc needed increases to accommodate fetal growth, and the FNB therefore recommends that pregnant women consume 3 mg/day more zinc than nonpregnant women in the same age group [ 1 , 3 ]. Similarly, the zinc requirement increases by 4 mg/day during lactation.\nNHANES data from 2001 to 2014 show that 11% of pregnant women in the United States have total zinc intakes from foods and supplements that are below the EAR [ 25 ]. Low serum zinc concentrations during pregnancy might increase the risk of preeclampsia and low-birthweight infants [ 39 , 40 ]. Routine zinc supplementation during pregnancy does not appear to reduce the risk of low birthweight, stillbirth, or neonatal death, but it might lower the risk of preterm birth [ 41 ].\nDuring lactation, some [ 42 , 43 ] but not all [ 44 ] studies show that adequate intakes of foods rich in zinc increase concentrations of the mineral in breast milk. Evidence is also conflicting on whether zinc supplementation during lactation increases the zinc content of breast milk [ 45 , 46 ].\n",
    "Older infants who are exclusively breastfed": "Zinc concentrations in breast milk peak during the first month after birth and then decline by approximately 75% by the ninth month [ 3 ]. Because of this sharp drop, human breast milk alone is not sufficient to meet the infant’s zinc requirement after age 6 months [ 3 , 47 ]. The FNB recommends that in addition to breast milk, infants age 7–12 months consume age-appropriate foods or formula containing zinc [ 1 ].\n",
    "Children with sickle cell disease": "Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) have a high risk of zinc insufficiency or deficiency, possibly as a result of the chelation therapy used to treat iron overload [ 3 , 48 ]. Children with SCD and low zinc status often are shorter and weigh less than age-matched peers, and they also have a higher risk of maturation delays, vaso-occlusive pain crises (blockages of blood flow to an area of the body), and associated hospitalizations [ 48 ]. Supplemental zinc might enhance growth in children with SCD and decrease the risk of bacterial infections, hospitalizations, and vaso-occlusive pain crises [ 3 , 48 , 49 ].\n",
    "Zinc and Health": "This section focuses on the following diseases and disorders in which zinc might play a role: the common cold, pneumonia in children, HIV in children and adults, acute childhood diarrhea (which often results from infections), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and type 2 diabetes (T2D). For information on zinc and COVID-19, see Dietary Supplements in the Time of COVID-19 .\n",
    "Pneumonia in children": "In low-income countries, pneumonia is responsible for 15% of all deaths in children younger than 5 years and for 19% of all childhood deaths [ 63 ]. Poor zinc status is associated with greater susceptibility to pneumonia, more severe disease, and higher mortality risk in children [ 64-67 ].\nSeveral clinical trials have examined the effects of zinc supplementation on the incidence of pneumonia and as an adjunctive treatment for pneumonia. A 2016 Cochrane Review of six trials in low-income countries found that supplementation with 10–20 mg zinc for up to 20 months in a total of 5,193 children age 2 to 59 months resulted in lower incidence and prevalence of pneumonia than placebo [ 63 ].\nHowever, most research suggests that the adjunctive use of zinc supplements to treat pneumonia in children does not affect mortality or time to recovery. A 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis included 11 clinical trials in children age 2 to 60 months with mostly severe pneumonia in low- and middle-income countries [ 68 ]. Mortality rates from pneumonia and time to recovery from severe pneumonia did not differ between children treated with 10–20 mg/day supplemental zinc and those treated with placebo for 7–14 days or until discharge. Another meta-analysis of six placebo-controlled trials that included 2,216 children age 2 to 60 months found that zinc supplementation reduced mortality rates from severe pneumonia but not rates of treatment failure or of changes in antibiotic therapy [ 69 ].\n",
    "HIV in children and adults": "HIV infection reduces the absorption and metabolism of zinc from foods [ 3 ]. In addition, people with HIV often have diarrhea, which can result in excessive losses of zinc. For these reasons, people with HIV often have low plasma or serum zinc levels.\nSeveral clinical trials have found some beneficial effects of zinc supplementation to manage the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection. One trial, for example, randomly assigned 231 adults who had HIV and plasma zinc levels lower than 75 mcg/dL to supplemental zinc (12 mg/day for women or 15 mg/day for men) or placebo for 18 months [ 70 ]. The supplements reduced rates of immunological failure events (CD4+ T-cell counts less than 200 cells/mL) by 76% and rates of diarrhea by 60% but had no effect on mortality. In another trial in Iran that randomized 146 adults with HIV to 50 mg/day zinc, 200 mcg/day selenium, or placebo for 6 months and then followed participants for another 3 months, the zinc supplements decreased rates of opportunistic infections but did not improve CD4+ T-cell counts [ 71 ].\nHowever, findings were less positive in two Cochrane Reviews and another trial (not included in either Cochrane Review) that assessed the potential benefits of supplementation with micronutrients, including zinc, or placebo in various populations with HIV. The first Cochrane Review, which focused on micronutrient supplementation for children with HIV, included two trials that administered 10 mg/day zinc with or without vitamin A for up to 15 months in a total of 128 children with HIV in South Africa [ 72 ]. One of these trials found that zinc supplementation had no beneficial effects in comparison with vitamin A, whereas the other found that the risk of watery diarrhea was 49% lower with zinc supplements than with placebo.\nA subsequent Cochrane Review that evaluated micronutrient supplements for adults with HIV included six placebo-controlled trials of zinc supplements (12–50 mg/day for 14 days to 18 months or 1 weekly 90 mg dose for 6 months) in a total of 826 participants [ 73 ]. The authors concluded that although zinc supplements might improve zinc status, the supplements appeared to have little if any effect on CD4+ T-cell counts or viral load and inconclusive effects on mortality and diarrhea frequency. In a trial in 400 pregnant women with HIV in Tanzania, 25 mg/day zinc until 6 weeks after delivery did not result in any differences in birth weight, duration of gestation, or rates of fetal mortality or early mother-to-child transmission of HIV in comparison with placebo [ 74 , 75 ]. In addition, zinc supplementation did not affect maternal viral load or CD4+, CD8+, or CD3+ T-cell counts. However, the supplements blunted the rise in hemoglobin concentrations between baseline and 6 weeks postpartum.\nMore evidence is required to determine whether zinc supplements might be helpful for people with HIV.\n",
    "Childhood acute diarrhea": "Acute diarrhea is associated with high mortality rates among children in low-income countries, where it causes about 525,000 deaths annually [ 76 , 77 ]. Zinc is used to treat acute diarrhea in children, especially in low-income countries where zinc deficiency is common. Scientists believe that zinc’s beneficial effects stem from its role in supporting adaptive immunity and maintaining the mucosal integrity of the gastrointestinal system [ 76 ].\nClinical trials show that zinc supplementation helps shorten the duration of diarrhea in children in low-income countries. A 2016 Cochrane Review included 33 trials that compared the effects of zinc supplementation with placebo in 10,841 children age 1 month to 5 years with acute or persistent diarrhea [ 78 ]. Most studies were conducted in Asian countries with high rates of zinc deficiency. The investigators administered zinc in the form of zinc acetate, zinc gluconate, or zinc sulfate. The most common dose was 20 mg/day, and about half the studies administered zinc for 2 weeks. The authors concluded, on the basis of evidence of low to moderate certainty, that zinc supplementation shortens the duration of diarrhea by about half a day in children older than 6 months and reduces the likelihood that diarrhea will persist for at least 7 days by 27%. In children younger than 6 months, however, zinc supplementation did not affect mean duration of diarrhea or persistence of diarrhea for 7 days. In addition, evidence that the authors deemed to have high certainty showed that zinc supplementation reduces the duration of diarrhea in children with signs of malnutrition by about a day.\nA 2018 systematic review and meta-analysis had similar findings. It examined the use of zinc alone or in combination with other treatments for acute diarrhea and gastroenteritis in 174 studies in 32,430 children, mostly from low- and middle-income countries [ 79 ]. The authors concluded that zinc was one of the most effective interventions of those examined, especially when it was combined with Saccharomyces boulardii (a probiotic) or smectite (a natural clay that contains minerals), for reducing the duration of acute diarrhea and gastroenteritis in children. Analyses showed that zinc alone or in combination reduced the duration of diarrhea by about ¾ to 1½ days.\nThe World Health Organization and UNICEF recommend short-term zinc supplementation—20 mg zinc per day, or 10 mg for infants under 6 months, for 10 to 14 days—to treat acute childhood diarrhea [ 80 ]. Most trials of zinc supplementation for diarrhea have been conducted in low-income countries [ 76 ]. Zinc supplements might have only a marginal effect on diarrhea duration in well-nourished children.\n",
    "Health Risks from Excessive Zinc": "High zinc intakes can cause nausea, dizziness, headaches, gastric distress, vomiting, and loss of appetite [ 2 , 3 ]. If used for weeks, doses of 50 mg zinc or more—typically from supplements or excessive use of denture adhesive creams that contain zinc—can interfere with copper absorption (which can cause low copper status), reduce immune function, and lower HDL cholesterol levels [ 1-3 , 97 ]. The amount of zinc obtained from food is rarely as high as 50 mg, so the zinc in foods is unlikely to cause zinc toxicity. Very high doses of zinc from supplements (142 mg/day) might also interfere with magnesium absorption and disrupt magnesium balance [ 98 ].\nAccording to a few reports, overuse of denture adhesive creams containing up to 34 mg zinc per gram of product can lead to neurological symptoms (including sensory ataxia and myelopathy) and anemia. Zinc-free formulations are available to prevent these effects [ 2 , 20 , 21 ].\nThe FNB has established ULs for zinc from food and supplements for healthy individuals on the basis of levels that have an adverse effect on copper status (Table 3) [ 1 ]. The ULs do not apply to individuals receiving zinc for medical treatment, but such individuals should be under the care of a physician.\n",
    "Penicillamine": "Zinc can reduce the absorption and action of penicillamine, a drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and Wilson disease [ 101 ]. To minimize this interaction, people should take zinc supplements and penicillamine at least 1 hour apart.\n",
    "Zinc and Healthful Diets": "The federal government’s 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA’s MyPlate .\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy eating pattern as one that\nIncludes a variety of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products, and oils. Some dairy products are good sources of zinc. Some ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are fortified with zinc. Includes a variety of protein foods, including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans and peas), nuts, seeds, and soy products. Some meats contain high amounts of zinc. Fish and seafood are good sources of zinc. Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Limits alcoholic beverages. Stays within your daily calorie needs.\nSome dairy products are good sources of zinc. Some ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are fortified with zinc.\nSome meats contain high amounts of zinc.
